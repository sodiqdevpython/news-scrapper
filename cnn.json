      "content": "JerusalemCNN—The first stop was Riyadh.Just a few months into his new administration, the president of the United States met the king of Saudi Arabia as part of an effort to push forward relations with the Arab world.From there, it was off to another regional capital, where the leader of the free world gave a speech about a new vision for the Middle East.Conspicuously missing from the itinerary was a stop in Israel.The year was 2009, andthe president was Barack Obama. His decision not to visit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had just returned to office, was viewed as an insult. It marked the beginning of what many to this day see as Obama’s fractured relationship with Israel, and particularly with the country’s longest-serving leader.US President Donald Trump (R) meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 4.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty ImagesBut as President Donald Trump prepares for his first visit to the region in his second term, the same elephant sits in the same corner of the Oval Office. Trump’s itinerary includes Saudi Arabia – where he’ll arrive early Tuesday local time– Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.The White House has called it a “historic return to the Middle East” and promised “a shared vision of stability, opportunity and mutual respect.” Israel is once again not on the itinerary. And after Trump blindsided Israel several times already – announcing talks with Iran, a deal with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, and direct talks with Hamas – Israeli officials are concerned another surprise could be coming.‘Without results, he’s not coming’Israeli officials tried to inquire about the possibility of a stop in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv during Trump’s trip, according to a source familiar with the matter. But the president doused the flicker of those hopes last week when he said he had no plans to stop in Israel.“We will be doing it at some point,” Trump said. “But not for this trip.”Trump might have been persuaded to add the visit to his itinerary if he could claim some sort of victory, whether it be a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, a humanitarian aid plan, or something else. But with Israel poised to expand its war in Gaza, there are no such deliverables. Even with therelease of hostage Edan Alexanderon Monday, prospects for a comprehensive ceasefire still seem distant.TOPSHOT - US President Donald Trump speaks to the press as he signs an executive order to create a US sovereign wealth fund, in the Oval Office of the White House on February 3, 2025, in Washington, DC.

Here’s what’s on their wish list“Without results, he’s not coming (to Israel),” said the source.Netanyahu prided himself on being the first world leader to visit Trump in his second term in February. On his second visit, in April, he became the first leader to try to begin negotiations for a new trade deal after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports. The prime minister left the White House without a trade deal and with a new concern: Trump’s shock announcement that the US would begin negotiatinga new nuclear deal with Iran.The problem for Netanyahu is that he has little leverage in Washington right now, said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat.“There’s nothing that Netanyahu has that Trump wants, needs or (that he) can give him, as opposed to, say, the Saudis, the Qataris, (or) the Emiratis,” Pinkas told CNN. The wealthy Arab nations have pledged trillions of dollars in US investments and may announce major weapons purchases, which Trump can tout as a victory for American manufacturing.Despite years of being perhaps Trump’s most vocal international supporter, Netanyahu has few cards left to play, Pinkas said. Under Democratic administrations, Netanyahu has used his Republican supporters to put pressure on the White House. But Netanyahu has never criticized Trump openly, and he’s unlikely to start.“He’s got nothing right now,” Pinkas said.‘A policy of surprises’As Trump’s visit to the region nears, Israeli officials’ concerns about what it will bring have only grown.In the weeks leading up to his trip, Trump has made a series of moves that have left the Israeli prime minister looking little more than a frustrated bystander. Trump has pursued negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program that don’t preclude the possibility of Tehran maintaining some civilian nuclear capabilities; he agreed to a ceasefire with the Houthis that doesn’t halt the Yemeni group’s attacks on Israel; and according to a Reuters report is also no longer demanding that Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel as a condition to facilitating a Saudi civil nuclear program.People hold portraits of hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza since October 2023, during a rally in anticipation of the release of Israeli-US soldier Edan Alexander at Hostages Square Tel Aviv on Monday.Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty ImagesAnd on Sunday, the Trump administration bypassed Israel to seal a deal with Hamas to free Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage in Gaza, with Trump framing it as a step “to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.”Israeli officials are now concerned what a week spent meeting with and being feted by Gulf leaders – all of whom have been critical of Israel’s military assault in Gaza and its ongoing humanitarian blockade of the strip – will mean for Trump’s posture vis-à-vis the war and ceasefire negotiations.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during the annual ceremony at the eve of Israel’s Remembrance Day for fallen soldiers (Yom HaZikaron) at the Yad LaBanim Memorial in Jerusalem, 29 April 2025 .

ABIR SULTAN POOL/Pool via REUTERSAbir Sultan/ReutersRelated articleIsrael vows to ‘defend ourselves alone’ after Trump strikes truce with HouthisLeading up to Trump’s trip, the US has been heavily pressing Egypt and Qatar to convince Hamas to agree to the release of some hostages, a source familiar with the negotiations said, in exchange for several weeks of ceasefire and the entry of humanitarian aid.The Trump administration now appears to be aiming even higher. Another source familiar with the matter tells CNN the release of Alexander will lead to “immediate peace deal negotiations.”A comprehensive agreement to end the war has remained out of reach, but Trump has made clear that that is his goal.“Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict,” Trump said on social media on Sunday.The result is that Trump and Netanyahu seem to be more at odds than ever, a situation that comes shortly after Netanyahu doubled down on the war and made explicitly clear he believes defeating Hamas is more important than securing the release of the hostages. If a deal with Hamas for the return of more hostages seems within reach, the US will drive up the pressure on Israel to accept it, another source familiar with the matter said.Until now, there were major doubts about whether Hamas’ leader in Gaza, Mohammad Sinwar, would agree to a limited deal. But Hamas seems to have shrewdly outplayed Israel this time around when it comes to Trump.And Trump’s visit to the region will serve as a pressure point to potentially unlock a deal.Trump moving forward ‘like a bulldozer’“There has to be a practice of no surprises” on either side, said Dan Shapiro, a former US Ambassador to Israel and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, DC. “Otherwise, the trust that is so essential for this partnership breaks down really, really quickly.”Jared Kushner looks on during a swearing-in ceremony of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 6, 2025. REUTERS/Kent NishimuraKent Nishimura/ReutersRelated articleJared Kushner quietly advising Trump administration ahead of Middle East tripTrump is moving forward “like a bulldozer” for what he wants, Shapiro told CNN, and that wish list currently includes progress on a ceasefire deal and a hostage release. Netanyahu’s tendency to drag his feet on major decisions and his history of prioritizing his own political survival appear to have contributed to the White House’s willingness to forgo consultation with Israel on key decisions, he said.“He’s clearly frustrated with Netanyahu, as every other president who’s worked with Netanyahu has been,” Shapiro said.Meanwhile, Trump’s man in Jerusalem, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee, has tried to downplay speculation about a rift between the two leaders, and said he would “fully expect” Trump to visit Israel this year.“No president has ever cared as much and done as much as President Trump has for the state of Israel,” Huckabee told Israel’s Channel 13 News in an interview aired Saturday evening. “And his relationship with the prime minister is, I think, remarkable.”Israelis see it differently.The front page of the prominent Yedioth Ahronot newspaper last Thursday showed a cartoon of Trump with the headline “A policy of surprises.” As Trump prepares a soup, Netanyahu sits nervously in the background.Even the ardently pro-Trump Israel HaYom newspaper has keyed in on the apparent rift with Netanyahu. Columnist Shai Golden wrote inan opinion article over the weekend, “The old saying ‘Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it’ perfectly captures the trap Netanyahu has fallen into with Trump.”",

      "content": "CNN—PresidentDonald Trumpsigneda sweeping executive orderMonday morning that promises to crack down on “unreasonable or discriminatory” practices by foreign countries that result in Americans paying far higher costs for prescription drugs.“Starting today, the United States will no longer subsidize the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing,” Trump said before signing the executive order, which he claimed could lower drug prices by as much as 90%.Also, drugmakers must start offering US patients the lowest price paid for a drug in a peer country, known as the “Most Favored Nation” price, or face consequences, the president said. He directed the Department of Health and Human Services to come up with price targets within 30 days.“Big Pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we will use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries to accelerate these price restrictions and reductions,” Trump said, although it’s unclear what authority he has to demand certain prices, particularly in the private market.U.S. President Donald Trump looks on inside the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 9, 2025. REUTERS/Kent NishimuraKent Nishimura/Reuterslive updatesTrump’s presidency: China trade deal, Middle East trip and drug cost executive orderThe executive order outlined some potential ramifications if manufacturers do not make significant progress in lowering prices, including directing HHS to craft a rule implementing the policy, allowing more drug importation into the US, reviewing drug exports, and having the Food and Drug Administration modify or revoke approvals granted for drugs that may be “unsafe, ineffective, or improperly marketed.”Trump’s effort to establisha “Most Favored Nation” rulefor certain drugs in Medicare during his first term was quickly blocked by federal courts for procedural reasons before being rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021. The new executive order goes far beyond that measure since it is not limited to Medicare nor to a certain number of drugs.It’s also unclear what power the administration has to get involved in other countries’ drug price negotiations with US pharmaceutical companies, though Trump warned that nations that don’t lower their price demands could face higher tariffs. He particularly castigated the European Union for forcing drugmakers to provide their products at low prices, adding that in many ways, trade with Europe was “nastier” than with China.“We’re going to tell those countries like those represented by the European Union that game is up, sorry,” Trump said. “If they want to get cute, then they don’t have to sell cars into the United States anymore.”The directive comes as the Trump administration is also looking to imposetariffs on pharmaceutical imports, which had been exempted from such levies enacted during the president’s first term. Thetariffscouldexacerbate shortagesof certain drugs, particularly generic medicines, and eventually raise prices, experts have warned.Drugmakers, however, did not seem rattled by the announcement, with their stock prices generally up in the early afternoon. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry’s main trade association, praised Trump for coming down hard on other countries.“The Administration is right to use trade negotiations to force foreign governments to pay their fair share for medicines. U.S. patients should not foot the bill for global innovation,” Stephen Ubl, PhRMA’s CEO, said in a statement.But the industry also warned about instituting a “Most Favored Nation” policy in the US.A US flag flies near the dome of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on February 25, 2025.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleGOP opts for Medicaid compromise in battle between centrists and hardliners“Importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers,” Ubl said. “It would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America – threatening jobs, hurting our economy and making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.”Some industry analysts said the order was more bark than bite and was not as hard-hitting as some had feared.“The announcement represents more of a headline risk vs. the industry sea change some had feared,” Evan Seigerman, a pharmaceutical analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. “Overall, most-favored-nation pricing could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy.”The legality of “Most Favored Nation” pricing negotiation is “cloudy,” and substantive long-term pricing reform would require an act of Congress, he wrote.Andrew Mulcahy, health economist with the RAND Corp., a nonprofit research organization, questioned how policies tying drug prices in the US to those abroad would actually be designed and implemented, especially without Congress’ involvement.“It’s much easier for the government to muck around in Medicare and Medicaid than in the commercial market or directly in the supply chain,” Mulcahy said, noting that most Americans have drug coverage through the commercial market.Wide-ranging executive orderHigh drug prices are one of Americans’ biggest health care headaches. They have long paid much higher prices for many medications than patients in other countries, in large part because other governments often determine the cost. US prices across all drugs — both brand name and generics — were nearly 2.78 times as high as those in comparable countries in 2022, according to anHHS reportlast year. For brand drugs, the US prices were at least 3.22 times as high, even after adjusting for estimated rebates. Notably, though, generic drug prices in the US are only 84% of what they are in the other countries studied.The executive order, which will likely be challenged in court, aims to reduce drug costs in multiple ways, some of which would get the federal government more involved in pricing. While US presidents and lawmakers have long decried that Americans pay higher drug prices than patients overseas, politicians have generally shied away from taking broad action in keeping with America’s free-market philosophy. This is particularly true for Republicans.While Medicare gained the historic power tonegotiate pricesfor a small number of drugs annually, Trump’s executive order will apply to a multitude of medications and to prices in the commercial market, as well as to Medicare and Medicaid. The president countered the idea that the directive amounted to “price controls” by telling reporters that the current system involves price controls because drug companies set the price.WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 07: U.S. President Donald Trump takes a question from a member of the media during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House on April 7, 2025 in Washington, DC.

The executive order calls on the Commerce Department and US trade representative to ensure other countries are not employing practices that hike prices in the US while keeping them low overseas.The order also takes aim at pharmacy benefit managers, the so-called middlemen between manufacturers and insurers, whom Trump has castigated in the past. It calls for HHS to establish a way for patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers, bypassing these middlemen.And it builds on Trump’sApril executive orderthat called for instituting changes in Medicare’s drug price negotiation program and making it easier for states to import drugs from Canada.It’s unclear when — and if — Americans will see lower prices.In a Truth Social post Monday morning, Trumpwrote, “Drug prices will be lowered by 59%.”It followeda postfrom Sunday evening that promised, “Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%. They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA! I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.”This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.",

      "content": "Maternal healthWomen's healthAbortion rightsSee all topicsFacebookTweetEmailLinkLink Copied!FollowThis story was originally published byProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receiveits biggest storiesas soon as they’re published.Nearly four years ago in Texas, the state’s new abortion law started getting in the way of basic miscarriage care: As women waited in hospitals cramping, fluid running down their legs, doctors told them they couldn’t empty their uterus to guard against deadly complications.The state banned most abortions, even in pregnancies that were no longer viable; then, it added criminal penalties, threatening to imprison doctors for life and punish hospitals. The law had one exception, for a life-threatening emergency.Heeding the advice of hospital lawyers, many doctors withheld treatment until they could document patients were in peril. They sent tests to labs, praying for signs of infection, and watched as women lost so much blood that they needed transfusions.“You would see the pain in peoples’ eyes,” one doctor said of her patients.Not every hospital tolerated this new normal, ProPublica found. A seismic split emerged in how medical institutions in the state’s two largest metro areas treated miscarrying patients — and in how these women fared.Leaders of influential hospitals in Dallas empowered doctors to intervene before patients’ conditions worsened, allowing them to induce deliveries or perform procedures to empty the uterus.In Houston, most did not.The result, according to a first-of-its-kind ProPublica analysis of state hospital discharge data, is that while the rates of dangerous infections spiked across Texas after it banned abortion in 2021, women in Houston were far more likely to get gravely ill than those in Dallas.As ProPublica reportedearlier this year, the statewide rate of sepsis — a life-threatening reaction to infection — shot up more than 50% for women hospitalized when they lost a second-trimester pregnancy.A new analysis zooms in: In the region surrounding Dallas-Fort Worth, it rose 29%. In the Houston area, it surged 63%.ProPublicahas documented widespread differences in how hospitals across the countryhave translated abortion bansinto policy. Some have supported doctors in treating active miscarriages and high-risk cases with procedures technically considered abortions; others have forbidden physicians from doing so, or left them on their own to decide, with no legal backing in case of arrest.This marks the first analysis in the wake of abortion bans that connects disparities in hospital policies to patient outcomes. It shows that when a state law is unclear and punitive, how an institution interprets it can make all the difference for patients.Yet the public has no way to know which hospitals or doctors will offer options during miscarriages. Hospitals in states where abortion is banned have been largely unwilling to disclose their protocols for handling common complications. When ProPublica asked, most in Texas declined to say.ProPublica’s Texas reporting is based on interviews with 22 doctors in both the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth metro areas who had insight into policies at 10 institutions covering more than 75% of the births and pregnancy-loss hospitalizations in those areas.The findings come as evidence of the fatal consequences of abortion bans continue to mount, witha new report just last monthshowing that the risk of maternal mortality is nearly twice as high for women living in states that ban abortion. Last year, ProPublicadocumented five preventable maternal deaths, including three in Texas.One second-trimester pregnancy complication that threatens patients’ lives is previable premature rupture of membranes, called PPROM, when a woman’s water breaks before the fetus can live on its own. Without amniotic fluid, the likelihood of the fetus surviving is low. But with every passing hour that a patient waits for treatment or for labor to start, the risk of sepsis increases.The Texas Supreme Court has said thatdoctors can legallyprovide abortions in PPROM cases, even when an emergency is not imminent.Yet legal departments at many major Houston hospitals still advise physicians not to perform abortions in these cases, doctors there told ProPublica, until they can document serious infection.Dr. John Thoppil, the immediate past president of the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said he was “blown away” by this finding. He said it’s time for hospitals to stop worrying about hypothetical legal consequences of the ban and start worrying more about the real threats to patients’ lives.“I think you’re risking legal harm the opposite way for not intervening,” he said, “and putting somebody at risk.”‘We have your back’In the summer of 2021, Dr. Robyn Horsager-Boehrer, a Dallas specialist in high-risk pregnancy, listened as hospital lawyers explained to a group of UT Southwestern Medical Center doctors that they would no longer be able to act on their clinical judgment.Dr. Robyn Horsager-Boehrer, a retired maternal-fetal medicine specialist in DallasLexi Parra for ProPublicaFor decades, these UT Southwestern physicians had followed the guidance of major medical organizations: They offered patients with PPROM the option to end the pregnancy to protect against serious infection. But under the state’s new abortion ban, they would no longer be allowed to do so while practicing at the county’s safety net hospital, Parkland Memorial, which delivers more babies than almost any other in the country. Nor would they be permitted at UT Southwestern’s William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital.Lawyers from the two hospitals explained in a meeting that the law’s only exception was for a “medical emergency” — but it wasn’t clear how the courts would define that. With no precedent or guidance from the state, they advised the doctors that they should offer to intervene only if they could document severe infection or bleeding — signs of a life-threatening condition, Horsager-Boehrer recalled. They would need to notify the state every time they terminated a pregnancy. ProPublica also spoke with six of Horsager-Boehrer’s colleagues who described similar meetings.As the new policy kicked in, the doctors worried the lawyers didn’t understand how fast sepsis could develop and how difficult it could be to control. Many patients with PPROM can appear stable even while an infection is taking hold. During excruciating waits, Dr. Austin Dennard said she would tell patients at Clements, “We need something to be abnormal so that we can offer you all of the options that someone in New York would have.” Then she would return to the physicians’ lounge, lay down her head and cry.Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in DallasLexi Parra for ProPublicaTheir only hope, the doctors felt, was to collect data and build a case that the hospital’s policy needed to change.Within eight months, 28 women with severe pregnancy complications before fetal viability had come through the doors of Parkland and Clements. Twenty-six of them were cases in which the patients’ water broke early. Analyzing the medical charts, a group of researchers led by Dr. Anjali Nambiar, a UT Southwestern OB-GYN, found that a dozen women experienced complications including hemorrhage and infection. Only one baby survived.The research team compared the results with another study in which patients were offered pregnancy terminations. They found that of patients who followed the “watch and wait” protocol, more than half experienced serious complications, compared with 33% who immediately terminated their pregnancies.Armed with theresearch, the doctors, including Horsager-Boehrer, returned to the lawyers for the two hospitals. Everyone agreed the data demanded action. Alongside physicians, the lawyers helped develop language that doctors could include in medical charts to explain why they terminated a pregnancy due to a PPROM diagnosis, Dennard said.At Parkland, the new protocol required doctors to get signoff from one additional physician, attach the study as proof of the risk of serious bodily harm — part of the “medical emergency” definition in the law — and notify hospital leaders. At Clements, doctors also needed to get CEO approval to end a pregnancy, which could create delays if patients came in on a weekend, doctors said. But it was vastly better than the alternative, Dennard said. The message from the lawyers, she said, was: “We have your back. We are going to take care of you.”A spokesperson for UT Southwestern said “no internal protocols delay care or otherwise compromise patient safety.” A spokesperson for Parkland said that “physicians are empowered to document care as they deem appropriate” and that hospital attorneys had “helped review and translate the doctors’ proposed language to make sure it followed the law.”Parkland and UT Southwestern are not the only ones providing this care in Dallas. ProPublica spoke with doctors who have privileges at hospitals that oversee 60% of births and pregnancy loss hospitalizations in the Dallas-Fort Worth region, including Baylor Scott & White and Texas Health Resources. They said that their institutions support offering terminations to patients with high-risk second-trimester pregnancy complications like PPROM.At Baylor Scott & White, doctors said, the leadership always stood by this interpretation of the law. (When asked, a spokesperson said miscarrying patients are counseled on surgical options, and that its hospitals follow state and federal laws. “Our policies are developed to comply with those laws, and we educate our teams on those policies.”)Texas Health and other hospitals in the region did not respond to requests for comment.While efforts to be proactive have meant more patients are able to receive the standard of care in Dallas, that is still not the case at every medical campus in the region. Doctors at Parkland said they have seen patients come to them after they were turned away from hospitals nearby.In other parts of the state, however, it’s been impossible to know where to turn.‘No interventions can be performed’In Houston, one of America’s most prestigious medical hubs, Dr. Judy Levison mounted her own campaign.The veteran OB-GYN at Baylor College of Medicine wanted hospital leaders to support intervening in high-risk complications in line with widely accepted medical standards. In 2022, she emailed her department chair, Dr. Michael Belfort, who is also the OB-GYN-in-chief at Texas Children’s. She told him colleagues had shared “feelings of helplessness, moral distress and increasing concerns about the safety of our patients.”Dr. Judy Levison, a retired OB-GYN, at her home in DenverRachel Woolf for ProPublicaThey needed training on how to protect patients within the bounds of the law, she said, and language they could include in charts to justify medically necessary abortions. But in a meeting, Belfort told her he couldn’t make these changes, Levison recalled.He said that if he supported abortions in medically complicated cases like PPROM, the hospital could lose tens of millions of dollars from the state, she told ProPublica. “I came to realize that he was in a really difficult place because he risked losing funding for our residency program if Baylor and Texas Children’s didn’t interpret the law the way they thought the governor did.” She wondered if he was deferring to hospital lawyers.Belfort did not respond to requests for comment about his stance. Nor did Baylor or Texas Children’s.Although Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has threatened hospitals with civil action if they allow a doctor to perform what he views as an “unlawful” abortion, he hasn’t filed any such actions. And in the years since the ban, there have been no reports of the state pulling funding from a hospital on account of its abortion policy.A spokesperson at only one major Houston hospital chain, Houston Methodist, said that it considered PPROM a medical emergency and supported terminations for “the health and safety of the patient.”Five other major hospital groups that, together, provide the vast majority of maternal care in the Houston region either continue to advise doctors not to offer pregnancy terminations for PPROM cases or leave it up to the physicians to decide, with no promise of legal support if they’re charged with a crime. This is according to interviews with a dozen doctors about the policies at HCA, Texas Children’s, Memorial Hermann, Harris Health and The University of Texas Medical Branch. Together, they account for about 8 in 10 hospitalizations in the region for births or pregnancy loss.Most of the doctors spoke with ProPublica on the condition of anonymity, as they feared retaliation for violating what some described as a hospital “gag order” against discussing abortion. In a sign of how secretive this decision-making has become, most said their hospitals had not written down these new policies, only communicated them orally.Several doctors told ProPublica that Dr. Sean Blackwell, chair of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Houston’s University of Texas Health Science Center, which staffs Harris Health Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital and Memorial Hermann hospitals, had conveyed a message similar to Belfort’s: He wasn’t sure he would be able to defend providers if they intervened in these cases. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and his institution, UTHealth Houston, declined to comment.ProPublica reached out to officials at all five hospital groups, asking if they offer terminations at the point of a PPROM diagnosis. Only one responded. Bryan McLeod at Harris Health pointed to the hospital system’s written policy, which ProPublica reviewed, stating that an emergency doesn’t need to be imminent for a doctor to intervene. But McLeod did not respond to follow-up questions asking if patients with PPROM are offered pregnancy terminations if they show no signs of infection — and several doctors familiar with the chain’s practices said they are not.The state Senate unanimously passed a bill last weekto clarify that doctors can terminate pregnancies if a woman faces a risk of death that is not imminent. ProPublica asked the hospitals if they would change their policies on PPROM if this is signed into law. They did not respond.Last fall, ProPublica reported thatJosseli Barnicadied in Houston after her doctors did not evacuate her uterus for 40 hours during an “inevitable” miscarriage, waiting until the fetal heartbeat stopped. Two days later, sepsis killed her.Barnica was treated at HCA, the nation’s largest for-profit hospital chain, which did not respond to a detailed list of questions about her care. With 70% of its campuses in states where abortion is restricted, the company leaves the decision of whether to take the legal risk up to the physicians, without the explicit legal support provided in Dallas, according to a written policy viewed by ProPublica and interviews with doctors. A spokesperson for the chain said doctors with privileges at its hospitals are expected to exercise their independent medical judgment “within applicable laws and regulations.” As a result, patients with potentially life-threatening conditions have no way of knowing which HCA doctors will treat them and which won’t.Brooklyn Leonard, a 29-year-old esthetician eager for her first child, learned this in February. She was 14 weeks pregnant when her water broke. At HCA Houston Healthcare Kingwood, her doctor Arielle Lofton wrote in her chart, “No interventions can be performed at this time legally because her fetus has a heartbeat.” The doctor added that she could only intervene when there was “concern for maternal mortality.” Leonard and her husband had trouble getting answers about whether she was miscarrying, she said. “I could feel that they were not going to do anything for me there.” Lofton and HCA did not respond to a request for comment.It was only after visits to three Houston hospitals over five days that Leonard was able to get a dilation and evacuation to empty her uterus. A doctor at Texas Children’s referred her to Dr. Damla Karsan, who works in private practice and is known for her part inan unsuccessful lawsuitagainst the state seeking permission to allow an abortion for a woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal anomaly. Karsan felt there was no question PPROM cases fell under the law’s exception. She performed the procedure at The Woman’s Hospital of Texas, another HCA hospital. “She’s lucky she didn’t get sick,” Karsan said of Leonard.Dr. Damla Karsan, an OB-GYN in HoustonLexi Parra for ProPublicaMany Houston doctors said they have continued to call on their leadership to change their stance to proactively support patients with PPROM, pointing to data analyses from Dallas hospitals and ProPublica and referring to the Texas Supreme Court ruling. It hasn’t worked.Houston hospitals haven’t taken action even in light of alarming research in their own city. Earlier this year, UTHealth Houston medical staff, including department chair Blackwell, revealed early findings from astudyvery similar to the one out of Dallas.It showed what happened after patients at three partner hospitals stopped being offered terminations for PPROM under the ban: The rate of sepsis tripled.Still, nothing changed.Sophie Choucontributed data reporting, andMariam Elbacontributed research.",

      "content": "Kyiv, UkraineCNN—For about 30 hours, theillusion of transatlantic unityover Ukraine was maintained.Europe and Ukraine had demanded a deal onthe 30-day unconditional ceasefire the Trump administration proposed two months earlier. European leaders said US President Donald Trump had personally backed their plan – and threat of sanctions if Russia declined to sign up by Monday – in a Saturday phone call, a picture of which they posted online from Kyiv.Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, even joined a chorus of US allies demanding Russia adhere to the ceasefire demand.But then Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke, refusing to even mention the demand, and instead presenting something old as something new: direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul, four days later. And transatlantic unity shattered. Trump leapt on the Kremlin proposal – simply stating on his Truth Social network that Putin didn’t want a ceasefire – and instead pressuring Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky to “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”President Donald Trump boards Air Force One in West Palm Beach, Florida, on May 4, 2025.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleTrump claims wins from foreign policy blitz, but he’s taking huge risksAgain, the pendulum swung back. Trump had been conspicuously silent as the US’ longstanding allies trumpeted their newfound unity. Putin spoke, and Trump realigned.Zelensky was left only able to show personal commitment and valor, and to offer to make the meeting a face-to-face with Putin, the man charged with war crimes against his nation. That is a tough move for him domestically.It is important to not exclude the possibility that, behind the scenes, Moscow and Washington are hatching something bringing the world closer to peace. But as Trump spoke, European leaders seemed to, in turn, fall silent themselves. Ukraine’s skies did not.On the night in which a ceasefire had been demanded, Russia launched 108 drones, carrying out strikes including one that trapped a 10-year-old girl under the rubble in Kherson region.Firefighters tackle a fire after Russian troops struck a residential area in Kherson district on May 12.The State Emergency Service of Ukraine/XThe significance of Saturday’s Kyiv declaration lay less in the immediate likelihood of an end to the fighting for a month. Europe’s leaders appeared intensely skeptical that their overture would garner Moscow’s approval. Instead, cynics might argue, the exercise was about proving to the White House that Putin was not interested in the peace, or indeed the specific ceasefire proposal, that the Trump administration sought.But that was not the only “reveal” that Europe’s four largest military powers got for their complex and lengthy trip to the Ukrainian capital. Trump also improved their perspective on his real position too.Putin is now thrice emboldened. He was able to completely ignore the European and Ukrainian demand – to not even mention it directly. Secondly, he has faced – as yet – none of the “massive sanctions” on Russia and boosted military aid to Ukraine that Europe appeared to suggest Trump backed, in the event there was no ceasefire.Thirdly, his proposal for direct talks in Istanbul – nothing new there, bar the date of Thursday – suddenly became the bedrock of Trump’s position. The US president held out the possibility of consequences if those talks were fruitless. But yet another step was introduced in between Russia betraying its disinterest in peace, and Ukraine’s allies escalating their measures against Moscow.The singular persistent theme in all the past few months of chaos is Trump’s reluctance to move in ways that damage his relationship with the Kremlin. We do not know if Trump and Putin spoke in between the Europeans’ visit to Kyiv and Trump posting on Truth Social. But perhaps we do not need to: Either way, when faced with a fork in the road between the unity his European allies seek, and a path in which Putin and he remain on better terms, Trump chose the latter.From left, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz make a call to US President Donald Trump from Kyiv on Saturday.Mstyslav Chernov/APThe threat of sanctions – massive or not – was always a complex task. Russia is already heavily sanctioned, and there are limited moves still to be made of real consequence, without damaging the West significantly too. Key is whether Europe tries to inflict pain on Russia without American support. To do so would expose their disunity, but may be a better choice than their threats in Kyiv ringing hollow.From left: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, France's President Emmanuel Macron, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz pay their respects to the victims of war at the Memorial for the Fallen at the Independence Square (Maidan) in Kyiv on May 10, 2025, ahead of a gathering of European leaders in the Ukranian capital.Ludovic Marin/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleUkraine ceasefire call is aimed at forcing Putin to reveal his war goals to TrumpThe meeting in Istanbul, if indeed it happens, is itself a hugely perilous step. Putin and Zelensky palpably despise each other. The former sees the latter as a pro-European traitor and а success symbol born of the imperial decline that Soviet-era bureaucrats have yet to accept. The latter sees the former as the man who invaded his country mercilessly without reason, and relentlessly bombs children, every night. It is more likely the men fail to find common ground than emerge, reconciled, with a path ahead.It is not impossible that the White House, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Turkey on the proposed date, and Trump in the region, tries to facilitate. Yet Putin has yet to even agree to attend, despite proposing the direct talks, making any acceptance now appear like some sort of grand gesture of peace. The United States being too deeply involved could backfire on their relationships with just about everyone.The simplest conclusion to be drawn from the past few days is that Trump fails to see that Putin is seeking to buy time. The Kremlin’s forces appear to be reinforcing, not reducing, along a front line where they’re pushing hard near Pokrovskin eastern Ukraine. The weekend’s deadlines have come and gone, exposing the brief moment of unity as an aberration, and the White House as unwilling to anger Putin.The possible meeting in Istanbul is only three days away. But it will not bring peace immediately, or perhaps even a ceasefire at all, just diplomatic pageantry and significant personal animosity between two men from entirely different generations in the post-Soviet world. It may even set the peace process back, and again delay the moment when Trump must decide whether he will join his European allies in causing pain to Russia for refusing a truce.What the answer to Trump’s postponed, vital decision, will be is already clear. How Europe and Ukraine fend for themselves is not.",

      "content": "CNN—Tariffs are costing automakers billions, but they’ve announced little in the way of car price hikes. While that’s good for car buyers, it’s not necessarily good for the American economy.Costs have ballooned for car companies after the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on imported cars — nearly half the US car market — as well as an additional 25% on imported parts, which every car built here depends on.Automakers would raise prices by double-digit percentages if they could – but there doesn’t appear to be enough demand. And given the importance of car sales to the US economy – the industry is estimated tocontributemore than 4% to overall GDP — soft demand for cars could be another recession warning bell.“We are definitely calling for an economic slowdown due to the tariffs,” said Erin McLaughlin, senior economist with the Conference Board, a research firm known for tracking consumer confidence. “This is another way we’re going to have an economic slowdown.”And that’s an effective, if somewhat painful, check on car prices.“We’re getting signals right now that none of (the automakers) are expecting to push the full cost of tariffs along to consumers,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Cox Automotive. “They understand that this isn’t an environment that regardless of prices moving up, that people are still going to buy.”Weaker car demand keeping prices in checkThe auto industry sold 16 million new vehicles to US buyers last year, almost half of which were imported. But there has been a sharp decline in plans to buy a vehicle, either new or used, over the course of the next six months, according to the Conference Board.Only 10.5% of American consumers intend to buy a car, and 2.4% intend to buy a new car, the firm found. That’s down from the 13.1% who were looking to buy as recently as December and the 2.9% looking for new.“People are nervous about inflation and tariffs, but they’re also beginning to be nervous about employment situation,” said the Conference Board’s McLaughlin, explaining the drop in car purchase intentions.Drone view shows cars at the Port of Baltimore, Maryland, on April 2, 2025, the day President Trump announced new tariffs on imported vehicles.Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersAutomakers will be watching to see if demand continues to drop,and if there are any signs the US economy could fall into a recession. That’s among the worst situationsfor car sales, and companies may just have to absorb the higher costs.Some top executives told customers and investors recently that the elevated costs won’t cause a spike in car prices. Instead, they expect lower profits — and lower sales — going forward this year.“We believe …pricing is going to stay at about the same level as it is,” GM CEO Mary Barra told CNN’s Erin Burnett earlier this month.“We now expect industry pricing related to tariffs (to increase) about 1% to 1.5% in the second half (of the year),” said Ford CFO Sherry House told reporters last week.Some car prices edging higherBut even without price announcements, car prices are creeping higher.In April, the average manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP), or “sticker price,” rose above $50,000 for the fourth time in history to $50,408, according to Edmund’s.Part of that increase could be due to the type of car being offered. Experts say tariffs couldhurt the selection car buyers have to choose from as automakers stop producing less expensive, and thus less profitable, models. Also, automakers will likely stop shipping as many imported cheaper models to the United States because they can’t pass on the increased cost.Experts predict tariffs will hurt the overall supply of new cars in the United States. And the long-ago established economic law of supply and demand means that taking millions of cars out of the supply could by itself drive up prices.Automakers themselves are reluctant to call attention to any price increases, out of fearsof chasing away customers and ofangering the Trump administration. Car companies are still navigating the ever-changing auto tariff rules from the White House.A 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E Premium eAWD at the New York International Auto Show at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York City. (Photo by Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA)Michael Brochstein/Sipa USAOf course, car companies have begun to hike the price for some models.Ford told dealers on Friday it would raise the sticker price by $600 to $2,000 on the three models it imports from Mexico — the Mustang Mach-E, the Maverick pickup and the Bronco Sport SUV.Ford stressed that the increase doesn’t apply to vehicles already in dealer inventories,and that it’s not passing along the full cost of tariffs. But it did say thosetariffs were a major reason for the rise.And even automakers that say they don’t expect a big change in car prices right now aren’t promising to hold the line longer term.“Pricing changes in our industry at least monthly, and sometimes more frequently,” Barra told CNN’s Burnett in their interview recently. “We’re going to respond to the market.”",

      "content": "New YorkCNN—US stocks surged on Monday after President Donald Trump’s top trade officials brokered a surprisingly dramatic de-escalation in trade tensions with China over the weekend, dropping tariffs to much lower levels, which some economists say could stave off a US recession.The Dow closed higher by 1,161 points, or 2.81%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 4.35%. The three major indexes each posted their biggest single-day gains in over one month.“The sharp market rally today reflects the unexpectedly positive tariff news,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, in a Monday note. “Many investors were not positioned for this outcome, leading to a significant market surge.”The Nasdaq, which had entered abear marketon April 4, closed up more than 20% from its lowest point this year — exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.)It’s been a swift recovery in recent weeks for the Nasdaq, though the index is still down about 3.1% this year.Markets cheer easing trade tensionsUS stocks on Monday firmly erased all their losses since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” trade announcement, which placed a 10% tariff on practically all goods coming into the United States and set significantly higher tariffs on dozens of countries. Trump paused most of those tariffs just days after they went into effect but jacked up import taxes on China — eventually to 145% on most Chinese imports.In turn, China hiked tariffs on US goods to 125%. The tit-for-tat trade war had effectively stopped trade between the two countries, risking substantial price hikes and shortages.Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both had said in recent weeks that tariffs on China had grown unsustainably high and a détente was necessary. But few believed that the result of the discussions between Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend was going to be quite so significant.Both sidesagreed to axe tariffs by 115 percentage points, still leaving the levies considerably higher than where they were before Trump took office in January — but much, much lower than the historic level over the past month that deeply concerned American businesses, consumers, economists and investors.“No one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in an email. “This is a big positive surprise.”Another key element of the discussions: Bessent said the US and China had put in place a mechanism to avoid raising tariffs on each other again, suggesting that the worst of the trade war may be behind us.Trump said as much during a Monday press conference. When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.”“No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.”Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.Richard Drew/APThe de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning.“The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.”As a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel.By contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions.

We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.”Bessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China’s economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war.“I had seen what’s going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.Historically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.”But, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America.

And Hassett suggested the agreement reached over the weekend should prevent further issues with supply shocks from China.“A lot of that is cleared up now — the potential for supply disruptions from China,” Hassett said. “I think it’s really a very historic fresh start in the relationship between the US and China.”But Hassett said the recent turn of events is not a contradiction in Trump’s prior policy.“The bottom line is what President Trump was saying was that if we don’t work out that good deal, we’ll be fine,” Hassett said. “The fact is that we didn’t sell practically anything to China. We’re buying a lot of stuff from China. We could buy that stuff from other countries, or make it ourselves.”",

      "content": "New YorkCNN—US stocks surged on Monday after President Donald Trump’s top trade officials brokered a surprisingly dramatic de-escalation in trade tensions with China over the weekend, dropping tariffs to much lower levels, which some economists say could stave off a US recession.The Dow closed higher by 1,161 points, or 2.81%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 4.35%. The three major indexes each posted their biggest single-day gains in over one month.“The sharp market rally today reflects the unexpectedly positive tariff news,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, in a Monday note. “Many investors were not positioned for this outcome, leading to a significant market surge.”The Nasdaq, which had entered abear marketon April 4, closed up more than 20% from its lowest point this year — exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.)It’s been a swift recovery in recent weeks for the Nasdaq, though the index is still down about 3.1% this year.Markets cheer easing trade tensionsUS stocks on Monday firmly erased all their losses since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” trade announcement, which placed a 10% tariff on practically all goods coming into the United States and set significantly higher tariffs on dozens of countries. Trump paused most of those tariffs just days after they went into effect but jacked up import taxes on China — eventually to 145% on most Chinese imports.In turn, China hiked tariffs on US goods to 125%. The tit-for-tat trade war had effectively stopped trade between the two countries, risking substantial price hikes and shortages.Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both had said in recent weeks that tariffs on China had grown unsustainably high and a détente was necessary. But few believed that the result of the discussions between Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend was going to be quite so significant.Both sidesagreed to axe tariffs by 115 percentage points, still leaving the levies considerably higher than where they were before Trump took office in January — but much, much lower than the historic level over the past month that deeply concerned American businesses, consumers, economists and investors.“No one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in an email. “This is a big positive surprise.”Another key element of the discussions: Bessent said the US and China had put in place a mechanism to avoid raising tariffs on each other again, suggesting that the worst of the trade war may be behind us.Trump said as much during a Monday press conference. When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.”“No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.”Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.Richard Drew/APThe de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning.“The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.”As a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel.By contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Japan’s yen fell 2% against the dollar.The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, sank more than 15% to its lowest level since the end of March. “Greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according toCNN’s Fear and Greed index.

      "content": "Reuters—Dozens of boxes of Nazi material confiscated by Argentinean authorities duringWorld War IIwere recently rediscovered in the Supreme Court’s basement, the court said on Sunday.The 83 boxes were sent by the Germany embassy in Tokyo to Argentina in June 1941 aboard the Japanese steamship “Nan-a-Maru,” according to the history that the court was able to piece together, it said in a statement.At the time, the large shipment drew the attention of authorities, who feared its contents could affect Argentina’s neutrality in the war.Despite claims at the time from German diplomatic representatives that the boxes held personal items, Argentine customs authorities searched five boxes at random.They found postcards, photographs and propaganda material from the Nazi regime, as well as thousands of notebooks belonging to the Nazi party. A federal judge confiscated the materials, and referred the matter to the Supreme Court.It was not immediately clear why the items were sent to Argentina or what, if any, action the Supreme Court took at the time.Eighty-four years later, court staffers came across the boxes as they prepared for a Supreme Court museum.“Upon opening one of the boxes, we identified material intended to consolidate and propagate Adolf Hitler’s ideology in Argentina during the Second World War,” the court said.Nazi-related material that was originally confiscated by local authorities when it was shipped to Argentina in 1941.Argentina Supreme Court/ReutersThe court has now transferred the boxes to a room equipped with extra security measures, and invited the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires to participate in their preservation and inventory.Experts will also examine them for any clues about still-unknown aspects of the Holocaust, such as international financing networks used by the Nazis.Argentina remained neutral in World War II until 1944, when it broke relations with Axis powers. The South American country declared war on Germany and Japan the following year.From 1933 to 1954, according to the Holocaust Museum, 40,000 Jews entered Argentina as they fled Nazi persecution in Europe. Argentina is home to the largest population of Jews in Latin America.",

      "content": "New Delhi/IslamabadCNN—India and Pakistan engaged in the most intense fighting in decades with four days of escalating conflict that included fighter jets, missiles and drones packed with explosives. It ended almost as abruptly as it began.New details reveal how a flurry of phone calls and diplomacy ultimately brought about a truce between the nuclear-armed neighbors and historic foes.And while the Indian and Pakistani accounts differ on some details, both sides agree the breakthrough started to come on Saturday afternoon.Theceasefire between Islamabad and New Delhi, which according to Pakistani officials had been in the works for several days, was agreed to after a “hotline” message was sent from a top Pakistani military official to his Indian counterpart, India’s military said Sunday, offering new details about how the unexpected deal was struck.In a briefing Sunday, India’s director general of military operations said that as officials were huddling Saturday “to wargame” the early morning’s strikes from Pakistan, he received a message from his counterpart in Pakistan seeking communications.Pakistan’s military confirmed Sunday that it reached out, but said it contacted intermediaries regarding a ceasefire with India. It did not specify which countries, although a Pakistani official involved in the talks told CNN it was the United States making the important calls Saturday.During a call, held at 3:35 p.m. local time, a ceasefire agreement was reached, according to India’s director general of military operations, Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai. He said a further call would be held to “discuss the modalities that would enable the longevity” of the agreement. Pakistan has not confirmed whether or not a call was held, but the official involved in the diplomatic efforts said Pakistan had received unspecified “assurances” from the US that India would abide by the ceasefire.The latest details of how the agreement was reached, which wasfirst announced by US President Donald Trump, give the clearest picture yet of how Islamabad and New Delhi directly communicated to agree on an end to the spiraling conflict amid growing international pressure.An Indian paramilitary soldier patrols the street in Srinagar, India-administered Kashmir on May 11, 2025.Faisal Khan/Anadolu/Getty ImagesOn his Truth Social, Trump said Saturday the US had brokered an end to the fighting and congratulated the leaders of both countries for “using common sense and great intelligence.” While Islamabad praised US involvement, New Delhi has downplayed it – keen to portray the ceasefire as a victory and saying that the neighbors had worked together “directly” on the truce.India’s director general of military operations, Ghai, said India approached Islamabad on Wednesday following its initial strikes to “communicate our compulsions to strike at the heart of terror.”India made a request – which was not specified - that was “brusquely turned down with an intimation that a severe response was inevitable and in the offing,” Ghai told reporters. The Pakistani military said that it was approached by India earlier in the week regarding a ceasefire.“The Indians requested a ceasefire after the 8th and 9th of May after they started their operation. We told them we will communicate back after our retribution,” Pakistan’s Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said during a news conference on Sunday. After Pakistan’s military operation, “we reached the international interlocutors and we responded to the ceasefire request,” he said.Speaking on Wednesday, after India’s initial strikes, a Pakistani official involved in diplomacy efforts said Pakistan was engaged with the US and that he hoped those conversations would bring positive results.He said Pakistan was going to give diplomacy a chance and hold off on retaliation as the US and others tried diplomacy – though India claimed Pakistan repeatedly fired drones and artillery into its territory, something Islamabad has strenuously denied.The Pakistani official said they were shocked when India attacked several Pakistani airbases early Saturday morning as they thought diplomacy was still in play. Pakistan immediately struck back, he said, harder than they had previously planned.Pakistan’s military called the strikes on multiple Indian military bases an “eye for eye” and said they targeted the Indian air bases used to launch missiles on Pakistan.The escalatory strikes from both sides forced the existing diplomatic efforts into a high gear – including by the United States, China and Saudi Arabia - to broker an end to the fighting.Residents watch a smartphone as Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif addresses the nation in Islamabad on May 10, 2025.Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty ImagesUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that he and Vice President JD Vance had spoken to the political and military leadership in India and Pakistan to secure an agreement before the situation deteriorated further.Vance had pressed India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi to find a potential “off-ramp” to escalating tensions, according to multiple sources at India’s foreign ministry. Modi listened, but did not commit, the sources said.China’s foreign minister Wang Yi also spoke separately to top officials in India and Pakistan and expressed Beijing’s support for a ceasefire, according to readouts from China’s foreign ministry.Just before 8 a.m. ET on Saturday, about 5 p.m. in India and Pakistan, Trump announced the ceasefire on Truth Social, writing: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.”Shortly after Trump’s post, both sides confirmed the truce.India’s Foreign Ministry said the agreement was worked out “directly between the two countries,” downplaying US involvement and contradicting Trump’s claim.But Pakistani officials heaped praise on Washington. “We thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region,” said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.A Pakistani source familiar with the negotiations told CNN that the US – and Rubio in particular – was instrumental in striking the deal, painting a picture of talks that were in doubt with trust at a low ebb and missiles attacks from India only abating in the final few hours before the truce was confirmed.It’s not surprising these bitter rivals give contradictory accounts of how a deal was struck.India, which views itself as a regional superpower, has long been resistant to international mediation, whereas Pakistan, which is heavily dependent on foreign aid, tends to welcome it, analysts say.The Indian military’s latest account of what happened raises further questions as to what exactly was Washington’s role in brokering the truce.For India and Pakistan, the truce – which largely appears to be holding despite early accusations of each other violating the agreement – has brought much needed relief to both sides.CNN’s Alayna Treene contributed to this report.Correction: This story has been updated with the correct rank of Lt. Gen Chaudhry",

      "content": "CNN—New Zealand cyclist Dion Smith got quite the scare during the third stage of this year’sGiro d’Italia, after almost being knocked off his bike by a runaway goat on Sunday.The bizarre incident occurred during the 160km stage of the prestigious race, which started and finished in the Albanian town of Vlorë, as the peloton was on its fast descent down a hill.Smith, who rides for the Intermarche–Wanty team, said he had spotted a small herd of goats by the side of the road and moved to the right-hand side to avoid any potential collision.Soudal - Quick Step's Belgian rider Remco Evenepoel is assisted by members of his team after crashing during the fifth stage of the Giro d'Italia 2023 cycling race, 171 km between Atripalda and Salerno, on May 10, 2023.

Meanwhile, the goat appeared unharmed and trotted away.“I didn’t have too much time to think. I could see it 10 seconds before, the policeman was trying to keep them all in, and then one or two started coming across,” Smithsaid, adding that he still loves animals.“I mean, what can I say? I didn’t know which way I was going to go, and everyone else went left. I chose right, but in the end, it was fine.”It’s certainly not the first time a wild animal has caused chaos during the Giro d’Italia.In 2023, adog caused a pileupafter running onto the road, forcing several cyclists to slam on the brakes in rainy conditions.Speaking after this year’s incident, Smith said he had been on alert for stray animals, but just never expected an issue with a goat.“I probably expected more of a wild dog, but I guess there’s a lot more goats down here,” he said, perReuters.“Albania’s been great and it’s beautiful down the south here. They’ve done really well and I’ve enjoyed it. It’s been a different experience, just watch out for the goats!”",

      "content": "New YorkCNN—America’s oil industry is facing immense pressure during Trump 2.0.Even though President Donald Trump vowed to usher in a period of American energy dominance, the administration’s trade war and OPEC’s production hikes have cast a shadow over the oil patch.In fact, once-gangbusters US oil production growth is now at risk of grinding to a halt — or even going in reverse.Hurt by weakening demand and depressed prices, US oil output is now expected to shrink in 2026, S&P Global Commodity Insights projected on Monday. S&P estimates that US oil production will dip to 13.3 million barrels per day in 2026, a 130,000-barrel decline from its 2025 forecast.It would be just the second time in the past decade that US production fell. The only other time was during the Covid-19 crash, when the world economy ground to a halt and oil prices briefly dropped below zero.“The US shale oil sector is quite gloomy. They’re battening down the hatches for a storm,” said Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group.Diamondback Energy told shareholders last week that US onshore oil production has likely peaked and will start to drop due to plunging prices.“We believe we are at a tipping point for US oil production at current commodity prices,” Diamondback CEO Travis Stice said in ashareholder letter.Of course, the silver lining for American consumers is that prices at the pump are very much under control. In fact, some analysts expect gas prices will trend even lower in the coming months, an outcome that could help offset potential sticker shock caused by the trade war.Sky-high tariffs have caused recession fears that have driven oil prices lower. Crude has also been hit by asurprisingly large increase in productionfrom OPEC and its allies.Trump hasrepeatedly called for OPECto ramp up supply, in part to drive down inflation and pile pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine.The ironic part of the gloom and doom in oil country is that Trump’s 2024 campaign was backed enthusiastically by the fossil fuels industry, and the president vowed to send oil production skyrocketing.McNally, a former White House energy advisor to President George W. Bush, told CNN on Friday that the oil industry “dodged a bullet” because a Trump loss would have meant tougher regulation and less leasing of federal lands and waters.But cutting red tape and green-lighting permits can’t make up for plunging prices in the short term.“While the long-term outlook from regulatory and cost perspective is improving vastly over what it would have been had Trump lost,” McNally said, “the president’s priority for lower oil prices is hurting the industry. That’s just true.”Even though the United States is the world’s biggest oil producer, it’s also most sensitive to price drops. US crude plunged 20% between Trump’stariff announcement on “Liberation Day” (April 2) and May 5, when it fell to afour-year lowof $57.13 a barrel.Crude has bounced back above $60 but remains at or below the level many drillers require to make money.In late March, oil executives surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas expressed alarm about the trade war.“The administration’s chaos is a disaster for the commodity markets,” one exploration and production executive said. “’Drill, baby, drill’ is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry. Tariff policy is impossible for us to predict and doesn’t have a clear goal. We want more stability.”McNally expects US oil prices to plunge into the low- to mid-$40s from late summer and into the fall, causing production growth to grind to a halt. He said if prices fall even further, US oil production “could easily” drop in 2026.“It’s certainly on the table,” McNally said.S&P executives warned on Monday that “extreme uncertainty about the future of US trade” and a looming supply surplus are expected to “hobble” US oil production later this year and next.The firm sharply cut its global oil demand growth outlook for 2025 from 1.25 million barrels per day before the April 2 tariff announcement to 750,000 barrels per day now.“The Trump administration is creating a regulatory environment that can facilitate oil and gas activity,” said Jim Burkhard, vice president and global head of crude oil research at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “But ultimately, it is the level of oil prices that is the biggest factor in driving US production up or down.”Cheap oil and weakening production could ultimately cost jobs in the oil patch or even cause financial stress for drillers.In 2020, when oil prices plunged and production crashed, the oil industry experienced a spike in bankruptcies and layoffs.However, the oil industry looks more resilient today because of a wave of consolidation in which Big Oil companies with powerful balance sheets gobbled up smaller players.In any case, the trouble in the oil world is a windfall for many consumers filling up their gas tanks.The national average price for regular gas fell to $3.15 a gallon on Friday,according to AAA. That’s down sharply from $3.64 a gallon at this point last year and a far cry from the June 2022 record high of $5.02 a gallon.Cheaper gas prices could help offset potential tariff-driven price increases elsewhere. And they have helped lower the US inflation rate.Veteran oil analyst Tom Kloza expects gas prices will continue to move lower.“It’s going to be a cheap summer,” Kloza said.",

      "content": "Hong KongCNN—Ding Xueliang spent his early teenage years in China as a fervent believer and practitioner of Chairman Mao Zedong’s revolutionary ideals — but he never imagined those memories would one day be stirred by a sitting US president.In 1966, at just 13 years old, the son of poor farmers became one of Mao’s Red Guards. He joined millions of young people across China to participate in the Cultural Revolution, a decade-long upheaval set off by an aging Mao to reassert his absolute control over the ruling Communist Party – with the stated goal of preserving communist ideology.Nearly six decades later, Ding is a distinguished scholar of Chinese politics based in Hong Kong, with a PhD from Harvard and a career teaching about the catastrophic movement he once embraced.But in recent months, he has begun to see uncanny echoes of Mao’s Cultural Revolution in an unexpected place: Donald Trump’s America.To be clear, there are profound, incomparable differences between the deadly violence and chaos unleashed by a dictator in a one-party state, and an elected president’s divisive attempts to expand executive power within a mature democracy.“It’s not identical,” Ding said. “But there are certainly parallels.”AsTrump upends the very institutions, alliances, and free trade order that have underpinned America’s global dominance since World War II, some in China are reminded of their own former leader — one who wielded revolutionary zeal to tear down the old world more than half a century ago.Inarticlesandsocial media posts, Chinese scholars and commentators have drawn comparisons between Trump and Mao. Some referenced the Cultural Revolution – at times obliquely to avoid censorship; others highlighted Trump’s apparent appetite for chaos, and the rising signs of authoritarianism and personality cult within his administration.Since returning to the White House, Trump has disrupted the federal bureaucracy – dismantling agencies, purging officials and slashing civil service jobs. He has waged a war on ideology that conservatives deem “woke” and attacked elite universities – including Ding’s alma mater Harvard – for “liberal indoctrination,” threatening to cut their federal funding. He’s also pledged to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US and “put American workers first.”And in the US president, Ding noticed what he said werestriking similarities with the late Chinese chairman whom he once worshiped as a young Red Guard: despite their vast differences, they both share a deep contempt for intellectual elites, a strong mistrust of the bureaucratic apparatus, and a populist appeal aimed at farmers and blue-collar workers.Mao Zedong, chairman of the People's Republic of China, on Feb. 21, 1952.AP‘Imitating Chairman Mao’During the Cultural Revolution, Mao’s Red Guards declared war against the “Four Olds” – old customs, old culture, old habits and old ideas – to erase remnants of China’s pre-communist past. (It led to the widespread destruction of some of the country’s most valuable historical and cultural artifacts.)That campaign stemmed from Mao’s long-held belief in “first destroy, then establish” – the idea that old systems, ideologies, or institutions must be demolished before new ones can be erected in their place.Coming from an impoverished family, Ding eagerly took part in public humiliation rallies against teachers, intellectuals, government officials and others labeled as enemies of Mao’s vision.“I was especially enthusiastic about the Cultural Revolution because I was born into a family of three generations of poor farmers — one of the ‘five red categories.’ At the time, I felt the Cultural Revolution was extremely important for us, it was wonderful,” he said.But as China learned over a harrowing decade, it’s far easier to tear things down than to rebuild them. Mao’s violent mass movement shut down schools, paralyzed the government, shattered the economy, destroyed religious and cultural relics – turmoil that only subsided after the leader’s death in 1976. Historians estimate somewhere between 500,000 and two million people lost their lives.Now, some Chinese are looking at that tumultuous chapter of their own history to make sense of the changeTrump is unleashing in America.Red Guards hold aloft booklets containing the writings of Mao Zedong as they lead a demonstration of some 200,000 people in front of the Soviet Embassy in Beijing on August 29, 1966.APAmong Mao’s most ardent admirers, there’s a sense of pride that the US president appears to be borrowing from the revolutionary playbook of their esteemed supreme leader. One blogger likened Trump’s Februarytweet— “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law” — to Mao’s iconic slogan: “To rebel is justified.”“Trump is adept at imitating Chairman Mao. Trump is China’s true opponent,” the bloggerconcluded.Other Mao fans cheered Trump for cozying up to Vladimir Putin’s Russia while snubbing Ukraine and Europe, said Wu Qiang, an independent analyst in Beijing who is studying Chinese perceptions of Trump.Ever since his first term, Trump has earned the nickname “Chuan Jianguo,” or “Trump, the nation builder” among Chinese nationalists — a mocking suggestion that he is making China stronger by undermining America.For some Chinese liberals, however, Trump’s sweeping expansion of executive power and attacks on press freedom, academic independence and the rule of law in the first 100 days of his second term have sparked disbelief, frustration and disappointment.On Chinese social media, users voiced their disillusionment in the comment sections of US Embassy accounts, lamenting that America no longer resembles the ideal they once believed in.“I always thought the US was a beacon to the world, standing for justice and fairness. But its recent actions have been completely disillusioning … Many Chinese people’s faith in America has been shattered!” said a comment on the US Embassy’s WeChat account.Others made oblique references to Mao.Underneath the embassy’spostcelebrating Trump’s first 100 days in office, a Chinese user wrote: “Sailing the seas depends on the helmsman.” That’s the title of a revolutionary song eulogizing Mao, which became the popular anthem of the Cultural Revolution.Another wrote: “The American people also have their own sun,” complete with a smirking dog emoji. Mao was extolled as the “red sun of China” at the height of his personality cult during the mass movement.US President Donald Trump attends a rally to mark his 100th day in office at Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan, US, on April 29, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters‘American-style Cultural Revolution’For years, Chinese liberals have quietly warned of a creeping return to the Cultural Revolution under Xi Jinping, the most powerful leader since Mao. A devoted student of the “Great Helmsman,” Xi has steered China closer to strongman rule and curtailed individual freedoms in ways critics say are reminiscent of that era.And so, it was all the more striking for some Chinese liberals to witness an authoritarian turn seemingly unfolding in Washington, which under former President Joe Biden had framed the US competition with China as “democracy versus authoritarianism.”Less than a month into Trump’s second term, Zhang Qianfan, a constitutional law professor in Beijing, was already alarmed by the emergence of what he called an “American-style Cultural Revolution.”“The Cultural Revolution was essentially a power struggle,” he said.Mao was insecure about his authority, eroded by three years of famine caused by his disastrous “Great Leap Forward” industrialization campaign; he was also suspicious of the establishment built by himself, claiming that “representatives of the bourgeoisie” had sneaked into the party, the government, the army and the cultural spheres.Similarly, Trump believes the “deep state” is out to get him. And like Mao, he turned to loyalists outside the establishment to reshape the system and bend it to his will, Zhang said.“Mao unleashed the Red Guards to ‘smash’ the police, prosecutors, and courts, so that loyal revolutionaries could seize control of state machinery,” he said. “Trump brought Elon Musk and six young Silicon Valley executives into the White House under the banner of eliminating corruption, waste, and inefficiency — akin to the ‘Cultural Revolution Leadership Group’ entering the party’s central leadership.”Zhang was equally unsettled by the growing signs of a personality cult in Washington.Last month, when he saw asocial media photoof a gold pin in the shape of Trump’s profile worn on the chest of Brendan Carr, chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission, he initially thought it was fake news or a parody.In China, such a badge carries heavy political symbolism. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao’s badges were worn ubiquitously by Red Guards and others as a public display of loyalty to the chairman and devotion to the revolution.A group of children in uniform stood in front of a giant portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, reading his 'Little Red Book' in 1968, during the height of the Cultural Revolution.Hulton Archive/Getty Images“During Trump’s presidential inauguration speech, Republican lawmakers all stood up and applauded with such fervor that it rivaled North Korea. These are deeply troubling signs,” Zhang said. “People are seeing all kinds of sycophancy in the US that would have once been unimaginable.”Trump has even publicly flirted with the idea of seeking an unconstitutional third term, saying he was “not joking” and claiming that “a lot of people want me to do it.”Mao ruled China until his death. Xi is serving a third term after abolishing presidential term limits in 2018 in a move praised by Trump.“He’s now president for life, president for life. And he’s great,” Trump said at the time inclosed-door remarks obtained by CNN. “And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll have to give that a shot someday.”‘Beacon of democracy’All the parallels aside, the first 100 days of Trump’s second term are radically different from Mao’s Cultural Revolution, which devastated China, saw millions of people persecuted and resulted in more than 1.7 million deaths, according to the party’s own count.Unlike Mao, Trump did not mobilize youths across America to form a nationwide, self-organized political movement. “The January 6 attack on the US Capitol was somewhat similar, but it didn’t take off – it did not become a national rebellion in the US,” said Ding, the former Red Guard.To Ding, the two leaders also differ dramatically in their global ambitions.“Whereas Mao’s Cultural Revolution had a grand goal for China to replace the Soviet Union and become the sole guiding force for the global proletarian revolution, Trump’s movement lacks such an ambitious, internationalist vision,” he said. “Instead, Trump has utterly damaged America’s image, credibility, and influence within the global camp of liberal democracies.”In many ways, Trump is reshaping the global order. He has disrupted the transatlantic alliance –a cornerstone of Western security for decades– and pushed Asian allies to pay more for US protection. He also narrowed the focus of his global tariff war squarely on China, effectively cutting off trade between the world’s largest economies – until both sides announced a 90-day reduction in tariffs on Monday.Wu, the political analyst in Beijing, believes Trump has a substantial base of support in China – larger than many might expect.“The enthusiasm for Trump — from intellectuals and elites to ordinary people — reflects a deeper dissatisfaction with China’s current political system,” he said.For many Maoists, Trump has sparked their renewed yearning for a political movement that can bring China closer to what they see as the social equality and ideological purity of the Mao era, Wu noted.Some in the business community believe Trump’s radical approach can finally push China to enact the painful reforms it needs. To Wu, their support of Trump signals a symbolic gesture: a longing for change.“What they share is a desire to see a Trump-like movement, or even a Cultural Revolution-style political shakeup, take place in China — a way to break from the status quo,” he said.Zhang, the law professor in Beijing, said similarly, Trump’s reelection reflected widespread political discontent in the US.“In this context, America’s ‘Cultural Revolution’ can be seen as a desperate response to the failure of democracy,” he said.But Zhang believes there’s no need to be overly pessimistic.After Mao’s final decade of turmoil and destruction, China moved away from the fervor of ideological and class struggles to focus on economic growth. It opened up to the world and embraced the global order that the US helped create, and the rest is history.“After all, every country makes mistakes — what matters is whether it can correct them in time,” Zhang said.“Right now in the United States, the breakdown and the repair of its social contract are locked in a race. If America can mend that contract before Trump and his MAGA movement inflict lasting damage…then there is still hope. The ‘beacon of democracy’ can shine again.”",

      "content": "Chiclayo, PeruCNN—Chiclayo’s main plaza was raucous with the sounds of hammering and music, people milling in anticipation as the scaffolding went up for vast digital screens in front of the city cathedral. Saturday’s open-air mass would be a very special one: a celebration marking the ascendency of Pope Leo XIV, the world’s first American pope – but better known here as Robert, the world’s firstChiclayanopope.Through the cathedral’s open doors, a line of women formed in front of the confessional in preparation for the big evening. A children’s chorus performed on the steps, competing with the thumping bass of secular life down the street, where two men in short shorts were leading a dance class. Banners draped around the square showed Leo’s smiling face, 10 feet high. Signs outside a local restaurant touted its goat stew as his favorite lunch order, back when he lived here.Inside the cathedral, Amalia Cruzado, 52, silently sobbed in the pews, her arms outstretched.“It’s a day of miracles. Chiclayo is so blessed,” she said. After praying, she would head home and pick up the rest of her family to attend the evening mass; her elderly father, suffering from cancer, desperately needed a miracle for his health.Amalia and her family prepare for a mass celebrating Pope Leo.CNNPope Leo was born in the United States as Robert Prevost, but for his adopted nation of Peru – where he acquired citizenship in 2015 – he is aChiclayano, a son of the bustling northern Peruvian city where he served as bishop for years, after working as a priest in the countryside.Here, everyone has a story about him.Back in the 1980s, Nicanor Palacios was an altar boy with Leo during his early priesthood in nearby Piura, and traveled the area with him for services. “Being the junior priest, he was often sent out in the field,” recalled Palacios, now an airforce technician. “He would take us out in the parish’s jeep to have lunch.”“It wasn’t hard for him to fit in. There was a small village back then, called Kilometer 50, on the Pan-American Highway. He’d take us there for dry meat and fried plantains. He liked that type of stuff and liked to go to the country. He’d eat just like a northern Peru farmer: yucca, fried fish, maybe a bite of fried meat.”“What I liked most was his advice, because many young people, even back then, they would get lost, but he was just a young man, 24 or 25 years old, very serious and full of advice,” said Palacios, whose mother died when he was young and for whom Leo and the other altar boys become a second family, he says.Video Ad FeedbackPope! Amigo! Peruvians remember the young American priest who became pope (David von Blohn/CNN)01:31- Source:CNNPope! Amigo! Peruvians remember the young American priest who became pope (David von Blohn/CNN)01:31Many years later, as a bishop in Chiclayo, Leo’s accent was still “very American,” according to local priest Emerson Lizana, 30, but his presence felt deeply familiar in this northern Peruvian outpost.“The way he treated people, his presence enveloped you in a sense of trust. He had a Latin American heart,” Lizana said, describing how the then-bishop became part of the daily life of Chiclayo, visiting the city’s poorest neighborhoods and carrying a cross through deserted streets during the Covid-19 pandemic.Searching for truth and searching for GodChiclayo is a city famous for the fervor of its faithful, even in deeply Catholic Peru. According toa 2017 census, Peru’s population is 90% Christian and 76% Catholic – more thanItalyand far more than in Leo’s nativeUnited States,where Catholics are under 20%.Leo, widely considered a progressive pope and ideological successor to Pope Francis, worked closely with the neediest in Chiclayo, coordinating local NGOs, churches and religious groups in the late 2010s to assist a flood of Venezuelans fleeing political chaos and economic collapse in their home country.But his tenure has not been without criticism – three women allegedly abused by a local priest released a letter in September last year accusing Leo of failing to fully investigate their claims while he was bishop. The new pope has also been called upon by Catholics for Choice tochange his views on abortion; an X account under Prevost’s name previously shared articles critical of reproductive rights and “gender ideology.”This undated photo shows Robert Francis Prevost. Prevost was Bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, from September 26, 2015, to 2023.During his tenure, he was elected second vice-president of the Peruvian Episcopal Conference and served as president of its Commission for Culture and Education.Conferencia Episcopal PeruanaRelated articleVictims’ group alleges Pope Leo XIV mishandled sexual abuse cases involving priests in Chicago and PeruLiz Medrano, from the region’s Moshikas Diversas LGBTQI+ advocacy group, told CNN that she feared Leo’s appointment could fuel religious conservatism in the country.“We are very worried. As you may have noticed, there is a lot of emotion in the province and in the region about the appointment of the Pope who was from Chiclayo. Ultra-conservativism, fundamentalism, new movements can emerge from evangelical and Catholic roots,” she said.“Above all it is the Church that has maintained this idea of being against abortions, that abortion is also a sin, that it is murder. And this continues to be referred to and repeated by the Peruvian authorities.”Abortion access is heavily restricted in Peru; in 2023, the United Nations accused Peru’s government ofviolating the rights of a 13-year-old girlwho was refused an abortion following years of rape by her father, and then imprisoned by local authorities after she miscarried.Still, for a pope, Leo’s social progressivism in other areas is seen locally as an overall “good direction” by some rights advocates.“We don’t expect that suddenly the Pope goes out and defends the rights of women, but perhaps he will take a position that is a bit more human, and less stigmatizing of women who interrupt their pregnancies,” said Rossina Vasquez, director of a women’s rights group in Peru.Padre Luis Fernando Oblitas, also known as Friar Pipé.David von Blohn/CNNAn interest in seeking truth and justice is part of the worldview of Augustinian priests like Leo, according to Friar Pipé, teacher at an Augustinian-run school in the outskirts of Chiclayo.“For us Augustinians, God is the truth, and for us searching for the truth is searching for God,” said Pipé. “What I hope is that Leo can be a pope who becomes a sign of unity for the church: we can always do better, through dialogue and understanding, both inside our Church and with other religions,” he added.Pipé, 30, was personally ordained by Leo in 2023 and blessed him in return per tradition; a blessing that he now jokes may have played some role in Leo’s chances during the Vatican’s conclave to select a new pope last week.He remembers watching a broadcast of the process on YouTube as it played out in Rome, his fellow Augustinians erupting in whoops of joy and triumph when Leo’s name was called out.With aChiclayanopope, now anything is possible, Pipé joked.“Let’s see,” he laughed. “When Benedict was the Pope, Germany won the World Cup. Then Francis was the Pope, and Argentina won… now, Robert is Pope, either Peru or the USA are going to win the World Cup.”But for believers like Amalia Cruzado, who have little but their faith, the sense that this is a particularly blessed time for Chiclayo is no laughing matter.The Cruzado family heads to mass. (David von Blohn/CNN)CNNIn her modest neighborhood, where Cruzado says children often go hungry or cannot afford shoes, dust rose on Saturday evening as a taxi bumped down the unpaved street, the decal on its rear window reading “La Bendición de Dios.”It was finally time for the evening mass.Her family of eight piled in – freshly dressed and coiffed, from her 9-month-old grandson to her 79-year-old father – for a hair-rising ride through traffic back to the darkening square. Street lights flickered on as they arrived, police still hard at work cordoning off the cathedral’s steps for the night’s rituals.Cruzado hoisted her grandson in one arm and shepherded her father toward the front, past crowds taking selfies in front of the Pope’s illuminated likeness. Soon prayers would begin, followed by a familiar order: readings from the Bible, the homily by Chiclayo’s new bishop,  communion.“Papa! Amigo! El pueblo esta contigo!” congregants chanted in the crowd, blasting airhorns and lifting their children in the air as if it were a home team game. “Pope! Friend! The people are with you!“Let me tell you, the Pope has two hearts: one is for where he was born, but the other one is for here, for us, the humble people of Chiclayo,” Cruzado said. “He is our Pope.”Amalia Cruzado and her father in Chiclayo's main plaza.

      "content": "CNN—PresidentDonald Trumpembarks Monday on the first major international trip of his second term — an opportunity to shore up relations with a trio of key Middle Eastern allies and prove his might as a dealmaker on the world stage.Arriving in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday with stops in Doha, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, later in the week, the trip echoes Trump’sfirst international forayin 2017.“Now, eight years later, President Trump will return to reemphasize his continued vision for a proud, prosperous, and successful Middle East, where the United States and Middle Eastern nations are in cooperative relationships, and where extremism is defeated in place of commerce and cultural exchanges,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, casting the trip as a “historic return to the Middle East.”But much has changed in the global and economic world order since Trump’s first-term sojourn: The president has dramatically reimagined and reshaped the US’ role in the world in his first months in office, and the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars have upended stability in Europe and the Middle East.Still, the trip offers Trump the chance to notch a few economic wins, revel in the pomp and circumstance of presidential visits, and highlight deepening partnerships.And what goes unmentioned on the trip may prove just as important as what is said.Here’s what we’ll be watching on Trump’s first big trip abroad:Pomp and circumstanceTrump’s counterparts are likely to roll out the literal and figurative red carpet for the American president. In 2017, Trump’s likeness was projected onto the side of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh, and there could be similar efforts to welcome the American president this time by world leaders seen as friendly to the Trump administration.“This is his happy place. His hosts will be generous and hospitable. They’ll be keen to make deals. They’ll flatter him and not criticize him. And they’ll treat his family members as past and future business partners,” said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Saudi Arabian King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud welcomes President Donald Trump during a reception ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 20, 2017.Jonathan Ernst/ReutersTrump is also expected to visit with service members at the US air base in Qatar, Leavitt said.During the president’s 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia, an image of the Trump, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Saudi Arabian King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud holding a glowing orb at a counterterrorism center in Riyadhspawned memesaround the world; it remains to be seen what this trip’s orb might be.DeliverablesThe president’s top priority this week is to procure “economic agreements” with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates that would enhance their investments in America, multiple Trump administration officials said.“The main purpose of the trip will be to give the president some wins. Trade and investment deals will be announced that will burnish the president’s image as a negotiator. Big numbers will emerge. Precedents will be established with applicability to the rest of the world,” Alterman said, predicting some deals in the artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency spheres.Experts expect Trump to pressure his counterparts to bring down the price of oil, an effort by the president to make good on a key campaign promise to lower everyday costs, though it’s unclear how much progress could be made on this front.CNNRelated articleTrump to accept luxury jet from Qatar to use as Air Force OneThere’s also the broader symbolism of the trip, highlighting the close ties and alliances between the countries and the Trump administration, particularly as diplomatic mediators with foreign adversaries. Qatar, for instance, has been a key mediator between Israel, Hamas and the US as the Trump administration pushes for a hostage release and ceasefire deal. And Saudi Arabia has been a key interlocutor with Russia as Trump’s team pushes for an end to thewar in Ukraine.The Trump administration is also expected to soonaccept a luxury planefrom the Qatari royal family that will be retrofitted and used as Air Force One during the president’s second term, according to two people familiar with the agreement. Following reports on the jet, Trump said Sunday night that the Defense Department plans to accept a Boeing 747-8 to replace Air Force One as a “GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE.”Given the massive value of a Boeing 747-8, the move is unprecedented and raises substantial ethical and legal questions. A Qatari official said the plane is technically being gifted from the Qatari Ministry of Defense to the Pentagon, describing it as a government-to-government transaction instead of a personal one.The specter of IranThe trip comes at a critical moment for US nuclear talks with Iran, led by Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who has emerged as a top adviser and diplomat. Witkoff led afourth round of high-stakes talkswith his Iranian counterparts in Oman on Sunday.A senior US official cast the talks as “encouraging” and said there were plans to “move forward” on technical aspects of the negotiations.“Gulf states are cautiously supportive of the administration’s Iran nuclear talks, in part because they fear they’d be the first victims of a war with Iran,” Alterman said.Trump has warned there will be consequences for Iran if a deal is not reached. But he is also likely to be pressed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE on the substance of any deal.The groundbreaking ceremony of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant in Bushehr, Iran, on November 10, 2019.Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images“There are two critical questions that we don’t have great clarity about and that I suspect our Gulf partners are going to press the administration for more clarity on. The first issue is: What would a nuclear deal look like? Would the administration accept a deal that allows for some domestic enrichments, or would the administration insist on complete dismantling of Iran’s domestic enrichment capabilities?” said Nathan Sales, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs.Trump said Wednesday that a decision on whether Iran can have a nuclear enrichment program has not been made.“We haven’t made that decision yet. We will, but we haven’t made that decision yet,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.Sales, Trump’s coordinator for counterterrorism during the president’s first term, said his second question is: “Would the administration accept an agreement that is limited specifically to the nuclear file, or will the administration insist on also addressing Iran’s support for regional terrorism — for instance, its ballistic missile program and various other forms of maligned behavior with which the region is unfortunately all too well acquainted?”Top aides and advisersThe trip also comes shortly after a major shakeup in Trump’s national security team. The president announced earlier this monththat he would nominatenational security adviser Mike Waltz to serve as UN ambassador after widespread reports that the president planned to oust him. Waltz had lost most of his influence in the West Wing after heinadvertently added a journalistto a group chat on the messaging app Signal. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is replacing Waltz as national security adviser on an interim basis.Trump will travel with a large delegation, including several Cabinet secretaries and high-ranking officials. Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are expected to fly to the region, separately from Trump, to participate in meetings. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is also expected to join the delegation. The majority of senior staff at the White House, including chief of staff Susie Wiles and Trump’s slate of deputy chiefs, will also be accompanying the president, senior White House officials told CNN.The president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is unlikely to go, sources said, but hascontinued to be a crucial playerbehind the scenes on Middle East talks.Background issuesPerhaps some of the most significant aspects of the trip are topics that are not expected to be discussed publicly by Trump or his counterparts.TOPSHOT - US President Donald Trump speaks to the press as he signs an executive order to create a US sovereign wealth fund, in the Oval Office of the White House on February 3, 2025, in Washington, DC.

The Trump Organization, which is being run by the president’s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is involved in major real estate projects in each of the countries he will visit. None of the president’s family members are expected to join him on the trip, Leavitt said.Speaking in Dubai last month, Eric Trump stressed the importance of ties between the US and Gulf countries.“This whole region is dependent on a strong America. And I hear that time and time again. I hear that from the biggest leaders in the Gulf,” he said, according toReuters.The Israel elephant in the roomIt is extremely notable that Trump’s trip to the region will not include a stop in Israel.Dynamics in the Middle East have changed significantly since Trump’s first term. Hamas’ October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks and the ensuing war in Gaza has caused a renewed rift between Israel and its Arab neighbors.Ahead of the trip, there have been discussions with Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, about signing agreements to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel, Trump administration sources said. Trump advisers have been privately plotting the more ambitious goal of expanding the Abraham Accords, the treaties negotiated during Trump’s first term between several Arab nations and Israel, those sources said.Israeli tanks operate in Gaza, as seen from Israel, on May 3.Amir Cohen/ReutersSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto leader, has stated unequivocally that Riyadh won’t normalize relations with Israel until there is a clear path for Palestinian statehood and a permanent end to the war in Gaza — neither of which appears imminent.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also said he is launchinga new, more intensive phaseof the war in Gaza, though an Israeli official has said it would begin after Trump’s visit.Notably, Hamas on Sundayannouncedits intent to imminently release Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage, with a source familiar with the matter describing the move as a “total good will gesture.”“The problem of course underlying all of this trip is the unsettled nature of the war in Gaza remains a bottleneck to any kind of breakthrough,” said Daniel Shapiro, a distinguished fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative and former US ambassador to Israel.Trump, Shapiro said, could use the trip to “unstick that bottleneck” and avoid “this major Israeli military operation that’s been forecast and approved by the cabinet, getting hostages out, getting humanitarian aid in, and taking some steps towards Hamas’ removal.”CNN’s Alayna Treene, Kristen Holmes, Kaitlan Collins, and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.",

      "content": "CNN—For an instantly recognizable contest that has settled untold scores it is, ironically, hard to get a firm grip on the origins of arm wrestling.As host of the World Armwrestling Federation’s (WAF) inaugural World Championship in 1979, the Canadian city of Wetaskiwin could claim to be the birthplace of the formal, global sport, yet descriptions of rivals locked in battles of the biceps stretch back much further.Versions of arm wrestling had already taken root across Japan, Spain and Cuba before the turn of the 20th century, according to anthropologists of the time. Some have even claimed it is depicted in the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt, though these assertions have been contested.Whatever its place in arm wrestling’s origin story, Africa is not looking back.Last March saw the sport make its first appearance at the 13th African Games in Accra, Ghana, a debut orchestrated by Armwrestling Federation of Africa (AFA) President Charles Osei Asibey.It was the latest step towards Asibey delivering on the promises of his 2022 election manifesto: to make arm wrestling a “household” sport on the continent.“Formerly in Africa, it was only a way to determine the strongest in the community, or even in schools,”Asibey told CNN. “So people didn’t even consider arm wrestling as a sport. It was just a normal game … We have turned it into a sport.”A sport of stylesThe technical term for an arm wrestler is a “puller” and it is technique, not raw power, that makes a champion, stresses Asibey, with training programs focused on developing all aspects of the body.“A lightweight who is smarter, has speed, [and] can swing very well will beat a heavier weight,” explained Asibey, who competed until last year.Such a matchup would not happen at the competitive level, with pullers classed into sex and weight categories, akin to boxing and mixed martial arts. And just as boxing has varying orthodox and southpaw stances, arm wrestling has its own battling styles that play to a puller’s personal strengths.Nigeria's Blessing Chika (L) battles Ghana's Rachel Lankai (R) during the 13th African Games.Nipah Dennis/AFP via Getty ImagesThe toproll style, for example, sees pullers turn their wrist inwards (pronation), and often lean back, to increase leverage, while the hook technique involves the outward rotation of the wrist (supination) to create a hook shape with the arm and pull the opponent in.Taller pullers with long arm spans make natural toprollers, while the hook style can be hugely effective for those with a background in powerlifting, bench-pressing or similar disciplines that prioritize tricep strength.During contests, the pullers’ faces are a visceral picture of steely concentration, sinew-straining effort, and fierce competition, but it is the mutual respect that defines the sport for Asibey.“Even in defeat, you congratulate your opponent,” he said. “You get to the table, you shake hands … you go off the table, you shake hands and hug each other.”Golden armsArm wrestling’s debut at last year’s African Games was a homecoming in all senses of the word for Asibey, with the Accra-born former broadcast journalist having founded the Ghana Armwrestling Federation in 2016.The hosts amassed 41 of the 84 total arm wrestling medals. That put them comfortably clear of Egypt’s 19-medal haul, but the North African nation gathered six more arm wrestling golds than Ghana to finish top of the medal table.Two pullers in particular embodied the team’s “Golden Arms” moniker, accounting for half of Ghana’s eight gold medals between them.Bukom, in Ghana, is a hotbed of boxing talent. Part of a coastal area in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, for decades Bukom has been a place where champions are made.CNNRelated articleHome of champions: Inside the Ghanaian neighborhood that produces boxing greatsMen’s captain Edward Asamoah powered to victory in the 90kg weight class for both left and right arms. A member of the Ghana Immigration Service, in 2017 Asamoahdecided to try his luck at a national competition and set in motion a rollercoaster adventure.“The journey hasn’t been very smooth, with injuries and financing, but it was worth it,” he told CNN. “Determination and hard work got me those medals.”It has been a similar breakneck rise for Grace Minta, a police officer who followed up her two golds in Accra by becoming the first Ghanaian to win a World Armwrestling Championships gold, in Moldova five months later.Having dominated continental events, becoming World Champion marked a new high for three-time African Championships gold medalist Minta, who took up the sport in 2017 after excelling in javelin and shotput at school.“I’m so, so proud to be a Ghana arm wrestler,” Minta told CNN. “I want to train the young ones who are coming, to organize them to also become somebody in the future.”Grace Minta (left) has accumulated titles at an impressive rate.Armwrestling Federation of AfricaOlympic dreamsThe challenge for Africa now is to replicate Minta’s success more regularly — no easy feat given the established giants of the sport.Kazakhstan dominated last year’s world championships, scooping 52 golds as part of a 159-medal surge. Turkey and Georgia finished second and third in the medal leaderboard.Egypt led the African contingent in 36th, two places ahead of Ghana, a fair reflection of their status as the “top notch” arm wrestling outfit on the continent, according to Asibey.He says that while Africa, which currently has nine nations signed up as members to the WAF, is well on its way, securing more funding will help close the gapto nations like Kazakstan which — partly thanks to the popularity of the sport in schools — sends more than 100 competitors to World Championship events.“That’s why they always dominate, because in those countries they have taken the sport very seriously,” Asibey said.“The Africa Games brought a lot of good things. Governments and institutions have recognized us … (But) We don’t have sponsorship yet. We struggle to raise money.”“We are confident that where we are going, very soon, multinational or corporate institutions will come to invest in our sport,” he added.Charles Osei Asibey has big dreams for arm wrestling's future.Armwrestling Federation of AfricaSuch backing would help Asibey to secure arm wrestling’s African Games return in Cairo for 2027. But while that is his short-term focus, he has even bigger aspirations.Though the WAF was unsuccessful in its bid to see para-armwrestling included in the 2028 Paralympic Games in Los Angeles, Asibey — who doubles as one of five WAF vice-presidents — believes it is just a matter of time before it makes the cut.That will be one step closer to his ultimate goal of seeing pullers battle it out on the Olympic stage. By ensuring arm wrestling is a regular fixture at his own continental games, he believes he is doing his part to make that dream a reality in the near future.“We are working so hard to be in the Olympics,” Asibey said. “Very soon we will get there … (Then) I’ll have a good sleep.”",

      "content": "CNN—TheKurdistan Workers Party (PKK)said on Monday it would dissolve itself, in what would be a historic move after decades of conflict with Turkey that have killed tens of thousands of people.The militant group said in a statement Monday that “all activities” conducted under the group’s name have come to an end.The Kurdish issue has come “to a point where it can be resolved through democratic politics,” the PKK said in a statement. The 12th Congress, a high-level decision-making meeting by the group, has “resolved to dissolve the PKK’s organizational structure and end the armed struggle,” the statement said, adding that the implementation of the process will be managed and led by their imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan.The statement did not clarify whether the decision would apply to all PKK affiliates in Iraq, Syria, and Iran, nor did it outline how disarmament would be carried out or what would become of existing fighters.TOPSHOT - PKK guerillas take positions during a patrol through a mountain pass along the Iraq-Iran border in the mountains of northern Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region, 20 November 2006.

Much of the fighting has focused on the group’s desire to establish an independentKurdishstate in the country’s southeast. But in recent years the group has called for more autonomy within Turkey instead.A demonstrator holds a picture of jailed Kurdish militant leader Abdullah Ocalan during a rally in Diyarbakir, Turkey, February 27, 2025.

The Turkish leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. In 2013, Erdogan worked with the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) on the brief peace process with the PKK.Talks collapsed and ties soured in 2015. Turkey’s war with the PKK has led to a sweeping crackdown in recent years against pro-Kurdish parties, who have been accused by the Turkish government of having links to the group and its affiliates.Kurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International.

      "content": "Hong KongCNN—The United States and China agreed Monday to drastically roll back tariffs on each other’s goods for an initial 90-day period, in a surprise breakthrough that has de-escalated a punishingtrade warand buoyed global markets.The announcement, which was made in ajoint statement,comes after a weekend of marathontrade negotiationsin Geneva, Switzerland by officials from the world’s two largest economies, during which both sides touted “substantial progress.”Both sides recognize “the importance of a sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship,” they said in the statement.Global investors arecheering a thawin the trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump’smassive tariffs, which have roiled financial markets, disrupted supply chains and stoked recession fears.Dow futuresjumpedmore than 2%, while S&P 500 futures rose nearly 3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite futures went up more than 3.5% during Asian afternoon trading. Asian markets were higher too, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index ending about 3% higher. The US dollar gained ground against other major currencies, while the price of gold, which tends to drop when investors are feeling more secure, fell.The mutual tariff revisions will be imposed by May 14. Trump’s 20%fentanyl-related levieson China, imposed in February and March, will stay. However, each side has agreed to lower “reciprocal” tariffs on the other by 115 percentage points for 90 days.That effectively means the US will temporarily lower its overall tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will cut its levies on American imports from 125% to 10%, according to the joint statement.Under the agreement, China will also suspend or cancel its non-tariff countermeasures imposed on the US since April 2. As part of its retaliatory measures against the US, Beijing had imposed export restrictions on some rare-earth minerals; placed dozens of American firms on its “unreliable entity list” and “export control list;” and launched an anti-monopoly probe into US chemical giant DuPont.The trade war has already affected the US and Chinese economies. America’sgross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed its first quarterly contraction since early 2022, as importers raced to bring in goods before punishing tariff rates kicked in.As for China, its exports to the US fell sharply last month, impacting the country’s enormous manufacturing industry. Chinese factory activitycontracted at its fastest pacein 16 months in April, adding urgency to Beijing’s efforts to roll out fresh economic stimulus.Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities in New York, said the agreement to suspend most tariffs on each other’s goods was a “best case scenario” from the weekend talks.“This is clearly just the start of a broader and more comprehensive negotiations, and we would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,” he wrote in a research note.Continuing discussionsThe two sides also agreed to establish “a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations,” led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, according to the joint statement.“These discussions may be conducted alternately in China and the United States, or a third country upon agreement of the Parties. As required, the two sides may conduct working-level consultations on relevant economic and trade issues,” it added.Speaking at a Monday press conference in Geneva, Bessent said: “The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled, and what have occurred with these very high tariffs … was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade. And I think both sides are committed to achieving that.”A spokesperson for China’s Commerce Ministry called the joint statement “an important step by both sides to resolve differences through equal-footing dialogue and consultation, laying the groundwork and creating conditions for further bridging gaps and deepening cooperation.”Beijing’s upbeat and positive tone stands in stark contrast to its previous statements about the trade conflict with the US. For weeks, Chinese officials had projected a defiant position, demanding the US remove all tariffs on China before agreeing to come to the negotiation table.The substantial, if temporary, breakthrough was unexpected. Just last week, Bessent sought to manage expectations by suggesting that his goal for the talks was “de-escalation” of tension and not “a big trade deal,” as the US and China had been at avirtual stalematesince Trump imposed his tariff policy.This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.CNN’s Hassan Tayir, Mike Valerio, Shawn Deng and Michael Rios contributed to this report.",

      "published_at": "2025-05-11 23:18",
      "content": "CNN—PresidentDonald Trumpannounced Sunday that he plans to resurrect a controversial policy from his first term that aims to reduce drug costs by basing payments for certain medicines on their prices in other countries.His prior rule, called “Most Favored Nation,” was finalized in late 2020 but blocked by federal courts and rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021. It would have applied to Medicare payments for certain drugs administered in doctors’ offices. However, it is unclear what payments or drugs the new directive would apply to.In aTruth Social postSunday evening, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order Monday morning that he argues would drastically lower drug prices.“I will be signing one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country’s history. Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%,” he wrote. “I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.”The directive comes as the Trump administration is also looking to imposetariffs on pharmaceutical imports, which had been exempted from such levies enacted during the president’s first term. Thetariffscouldexacerbate shortagesof certain drugs, particularly generic medicines, and eventually raise prices.CNNRelated articleTrump to accept luxury jet from Qatar to use as Air Force OneIf the new executive order is comparable to the 2020 rule, both Medicare and its beneficiaries could see savings. But it could also limit patients’ access to medications, experts said. Much depends on how the policy is structured.At least one health care policy analyst threw cold water on Trump’s claim that his latest effort would greatly reduce drug costs.“Trump has a long history in his first term of talking bigger on drug pricing than what his policies would actually do,” Chris Meekins, an analyst with Raymond James, wrote in a note to clients Sunday evening. “The more grandiose Trump’s proposed executive actions, the less likely they are to be implemented as successful court challenges will be much more likely.”Although lowering drug prices was a major talking point of his first administration, Trump has not focused on the topic as much this term. And his campaign toldPoliticolast year that he had moved away from the “Most Favored Nation” model, which many Republicans strongly oppose.But the administration revived the idea recently as a potential way to meet deep spending cut targets for Medicaid in the House GOP’s sweepingtax and spending cuts package. However, it’s unclear whether the proposal will be included in the legislation, the details of which should be announced shortly, or whether it would be covered by the executive order.The initiative will likely face stiff opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which successfully halted the first iteration.“This Foreign First Pricing scheme is a bad deal for American patients. Importing foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,” Stephen Ubl, CEO of PhRMA, the industry’s main trade group, said in a statement. “It jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.”The Trump administrationintroducedthe idea of tying Medicare’s drug reimbursements to the prices in other countries in 2018 andfinalized the rulejust after the 2020 election. The seven-year model would have allowed the US to piggyback on discounts negotiated by other peer countries, which typically pay far less for medications in large part because their governments often determine the cost.Under the 2020 initiative, Medicare would have paid the lowest price available among those peer countries for 50 Part B drugs that are administered in doctors’ offices. The administration estimated it would have saved about $86 billion.At the time, Medicare was barred from negotiating drug prices, but that changed with the 2022 passage of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, which gave Medicare thehistoric powerto bargain over prices for a small number of drugs annually.A “Most Favored Nation” proposal could save beneficiaries’ money in their out-of-pocket costs and their premiums, which are both affected by the price of drugs, experts said.This story has been updated with additional information.",

The potential agreement with China comes after Trump announced Thursday that a deal wasmade with the United Kingdom.Tariffs will likely remain in place between the United States and China but not at the massive levels that were imposed by Trump in April.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the United States was not willing to set tariff rates lower than 10% when negotiating with countries.

It thanked first responders from additional municipalities who acted “quickly with courage, compassion, and integrity.”The fire department confirmed a fifth death in connection with the blaze Monday morning, after initially reporting four fatalities.Dozens of others were hurt, the department said, after the fire broke out before 8 a.m.,CNN affiliate WISNreported. Around 30 fire trucks responded to the five-alarm blaze.Medics were seen performing CPR outside the building and some residents were carried to ambulances on stretchers, according to WISN. Firefighters entered the building and used ladders to rescue 30 people,CNN affiliate WTMJ said.Both affiliates quoted crews as saying the building did not have a working sprinkler system but did not require one, as it was built before 1974, WTMJ reported.Residents described seeing people leaping out windows and off balconies toCNN affiliate WDJT.One resident told WDJT people had jumped from the top floor. “You got people jumping out of the building, people jumping off the fourth floor,” Emerald Gransberry told the station.Gransberry said his apartment had filled with smoke and he opened his door to a hallway in flames.Hundreds of people are left displaced after the fire, WDJT said. TheRed Crossis assisting residents.Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said it was a sad day for the city.“I spoke with both firefighters and displaced residents and heard about a number of dramatic escapes and rescues from the burning apartment building.“Authorities are looking into what caused the blaze. My thoughts are with all those affected by this tragedy,”Johnson wrote alongside a photo on Facebookshowing him with firefighters outside the building.In 2021, the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Servicesresumed enforcing a coderequiring sprinkler systems in some multifamily dwellings. Since April that year, building plans for most dwellings with three or more units have needed to have automatic fire sprinkler systems installed.WDJT quoted Milwaukee Fire Chief Aaron Lipski as saying Sunday’s fire could have been prevented if sprinklers were also mandatory for buildings built before 1974.“Nobody ​was ​required ​to ​go ​back ​and ​make ​that ​building ​fire ​safe. ​And ​you ​result ​with ​this ​today. ​We ​have ​fought ​this ​fight ​for ​many, ​many ​years ​across ​the ​United ​States.

      "content": "JerusalemCNN—Hamas has announced the imminent release of Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage held inGaza.The head of Hamas’ negotiating team said they had been in contact with the US administration “during the past few days” in talks that “showed high positivity.”Following the communications, Hamas announced it will release Alexander as part of thesteps toward a ceasefirethat will see the crossings into Gaza opened and humanitarian aid brought into Gaza following an Israeli blockade that has lasted more than two months.“The movement affirms its readiness to immediately start intensive negotiations, and make serious efforts to reach a final agreement to stop the war, exchange prisoners in an agreed manner, and manage the Gaza Strip by an independent professional body,” Khalil Al-Hayya said in a statement.The Alexander family described the news on Mother’s Day as “the greatest gift imaginable” and thanked US President Donald Trump, his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the US administration for their “tireless work to make this happen.”In a post on Truth Social, Trump hailed the development as “monumental news,” describing it as a “step taken in good faith toward the United States and the efforts of the mediators – Qatar and Egypt – to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.”The release could be as early as Monday but is more likely to occur on Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi told the Hamas-affiliated Al Aqsa TV that they conducted direct negotiations with the US that would lead to the resumption of humanitarian aid into Gaza.According to a third source familiar with the matter, Witkoff will arrive in Tel Aviv Monday morning ahead of the release of Alexander. Witkoff told CNN the talks with Hamas were indirect.The source called it “a total good will gesture,” especially since it comes with Israel poised to expand its military operations in Gaza.The parents of Edan Alexander, believed to be the last living U.S. citizen being held hostage in Gaza, speak with Wolf Blitzer about their hopes to have their son released.Clipped From VideovideoRelated videoWolf speaks with the parents of the last living U.S. citizen being held hostage in GazaIsrael is not expected to release any Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Alexander.“We’re going to go into immediate peace deal negotiations,” the source said.US Special Envoy for Hostage Response Adam Boehler will travel with the parents of Alexander to Israel for their son’s expected release, he told CNN Sunday.Boehler and Adi and Yael Alexander will land in Israel on Monday.“There was a team-led effort that the president really focused on Edan and then (US Secretary of State) Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff made it a huge focus,” Boehler said. He would not give further details about the negotiations, but noted that “the signals have been very good.”Boehler said that Trump remains committed to the release of all of the hostages and the return of US remains.Alexander’s release “should be viewed by Israelis and Americans alike as a first important step,” he told CNN.In a closed meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Sunday evening in the Knesset, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the members that Hamas may soon release Alexander, according to another source familiar with the matter.The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that it had been informed by the US of Hamas’ intention to release Alexander “without compensation or conditions.”Israel has not committed to a ceasefire, nor the release of any Palestinian prisoners, only to “a safe corridor that will allow for Edan’s release,” Netanyahu’s office said.The release is expected to lead to talks for the freeing of more hostages, but the prime minister has said that “negotiations will take place under fire.”News of the announcement of Alexander’s release was first reported by Axios.‘Bring them all home’The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Alexander’s release must be the beginning of a “comprehensive” agreement to secure the release of all the hostages.“Prime Minister Netanyahu must immediately fulfill the supreme moral obligation – and the demand of the vast majority of the Israeli public – to bring everyone back,” the forum said. “President Trump, you’ve given the families of all the hostages hope. Please, complete your mission and bring them all home.”Alexander, who was serving in the Israeli military when he was abducted by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, is one of 59 hostages still held in Gaza. Last week, Trump said that only 21 of the hostages were still alive, fewer than Israel’s official count of 24 living hostages. Trump’s surprise announcementforced Netanyahu to acknowledgethat there are three hostages “where there is doubt whether they are alive.”Among the hostages are four deceased American citizens, including husband and wife Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai, as well as soldiers Itay Chen and Omer Neutra.In an interview aired on Saturday evening, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee called the return of the hostages “the highest priority that the president has as it related to this country.”In a joint statement, Qatar and Egypt called Alexander’s release “an encouraging step for the parties to return to the negotiating table for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the release of prisoners and detainees, and ensuring the safe and unhindered flow of aid to address the tragic situation in the Strip.”Alexander’s release is “part of the steps taken” for humanitarian aid to once again flow into Gaza, according to Hamas, following a complete Israeli blockade of the territory that began on March 2. Since then, food stocks have run out at warehouses and food kitchens across Gaza as the enclave has moved closer to famine.Protesters hold photos of hostages who were killed in Hamas captivity during Israel's annual Memorial Day for the fallen soldiers who died in the nation's conflicts and victims of nationalistic attacks on April 29 in Tel Aviv, Israel.Amir Levy/Getty ImagesRelated articleOctober 7 families demand to know the number of Gaza hostages still alive, after Trump said 3 more have diedThe Ministry of Health in Gaza said Sunday there were severe shortages of medical supplies, warning that 43% of essential medication is currently out of stock.

      "content": "CNN—President Donald Trump said Sunday night that the Defense Department plans to accept a Boeing 747-8 jet to replace Air Force One as a “GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE.”CNN reported earlier Sunday that the Trump administration was set to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family that will be retrofitted and used as Air Force One during the president’s second term, according to two people familiar with the agreement.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the multimillion dollar jet would be used on a temporary basis “in a very public and transparent transaction.”Trumpis set to embark Monday on his first major foreign trip, which includes a stop in Doha, Qatar.Given the massive value of a Boeing 747-8, the move is unprecedented and raises substantial ethical and legal questions. A Qatari official said the plane is technically being gifted from the Qatari Ministry of Defense to the Pentagon, describing it more as a government-to-government transaction instead of a personal one. The Defense Department will then retrofit the plane for the president’s use with security features and modifications.The plan is for the plane to eventually be donated to Trump’s presidential library after he leaves office, ensuring he can continue to use it, according to a person familiar.“The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense, but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,” Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar’s media attaché to the US, said Sunday.WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 29: U.S. President Donald Trump takes a question from a reporter before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on April 29, 2025 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageslive updatesTrump’s presidency: US officials tout progress in China trade talksWithin the Secret Service, the potential gifting of a plane by a foreign government for presidential use is being viewed as a “security nightmare,” a law enforcement source told CNN.“The (US Air Force) would have to tear it apart looking for surveillance equipment and inspect the integrity of the plane,” the source said.Another source familiar with that process said it will begin with the White House Communications Agency, which will then ask the CIA and National Security Agency to conduct a technical countermeasures sweep.Democrats quickly condemned the news Sunday, with the Democratic National Committee describing it in anews releaseas “Trump’s latest grift.”“Nothing says ‘America First’ like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in astatement. “It’s not just bribery, it’s premium foreign influence with extra legroom.”Trump cast aside that criticism from Democrats in his Truth Social post on Sunday, but the expected move has drawn rebuke from at least one of his most loyal supporters,Laura Loomer, a far-right provocateur whomet with the presidentin the Oval Office earlier this spring. While Loomer said she would “take a bullet” for the president, she criticized Trump, arguing that accepting the plane would be a “stain” on the administration “if this is true.”ABC Newsfirst reportedon the new plane.Trump and aides toured the plane earlier this year at the airport in Palm Beach, Florida, and it is expected to be in use within two years, one person told CNN.Following his tour, Trump has boasted to people around him about how luxurious the plane was.“President Trump is touring a new Boeing plane to checkout the new hardware/technology,” White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement at the time.News raises ethics questionsThe news comes as government watchdog groups have bristled at how publicly the president isflaunting the norms of the office.Jordan Libowitz, a spokesperson for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the potential move is a sharp departure from the playbook presidents have followed to ensure they stay in line with the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause, which bans foreign payments to a sitting US president.“We’ve never seen something on the level of a $400 million plane,” he said. “It is a scale well beyond anything we’ve ever seen before.”US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, left, and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, left, speak to the press after the second day of a bilateral meeting between the United States and China, in Geneva, Switzerland, Sunday, May 11, 2025.Martial Trezzini/Keystone via APRelated articleTop US officials emerge from China trade talks touting ‘substantial progress’ and ‘deal’Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said that the Trump administration is “structuring a transaction to try to avoid the obvious application of the law” and that because Congress has not consented to the gift, it violates the clause.“It is ridiculous. It’s a gift to Trump. The federal government is a pass-through,” Clark added.During Trump’s first term, legal disputes arose concerning whether he had violated the emoluments clause by illegally profiting from his business ventures while in public office, Clark noted. In 2021, the Supreme Courtdismissed the casesagainst Trump because he was no longer in office.“Trump thinks he will get away with this $400 million payoff from Qatar because he got away with multiple emoluments clause violations in his first term, and neither Congress nor the court would enforce the Constitution’s anti-corruption clause,” Clark said.Boeing’s Air Force One woesReplacing the Air Force One aircraft has long been a priority for Trump. Boeing has been working toward renovating two 747 jets into next-generation Air Force One aircraft, but the process has beenwracked by delays. The planes had been scheduled to be delivered by 2022 and now aren’t expecteduntil at least 2027.Cheung said earlier this year that Trump’s tour of the plane in Palm Beach “highlights the project’s failure to deliver a new Air Force One on time as promised, as they are already 5 years late.”Boeing’s $3.9 billion contract to replace the two Air Force One jets has become an expensive and embarrassing albatross. The company has already reported losses totaling $2.5 billion already on the program, known as VC-25B, since it agreed to be responsible for what has become soaring cost overruns.Air Force One landing in a 2023 photo.

Bush.Trump has been deeply frustrated by the delays in replacing the aircraft, at one pointtapping Elon Muskto help accelerate the process.“I’m not happy with the fact that it’s taken so long,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One in February. “There’s no excuse for it.” He said he wouldn’t turn to Boeing’s European rival, Airbus, but would consider buying a used 747 and having a different company refurbish it for use as Air Force One.The challenge is not the basic jet, but what it takes to turn a run-of-the-mill Boeing 747 into the flying communications and command post fit for the president of the United States, Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace consulting firm, previously told CNN. They are supposed to be able to protect its occupants from missile attacks or even the shock waves of a nuclear blast.“You can have a jet anytime,” he said. “But it takes a great deal of work to have encrypted communications and manage the military and federal government from anywhere around the world in any circumstance.”The Qatari Boeing 747 aircraft has been in San Antonio, Texas, for the past month, according to a person familiar.This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.CNN’s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Betsy Klein, Kylie Atwood, Chris Isidore, Josh Campbell and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

China retaliated with 125% on US goods.“The president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we’re confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to resolve work toward resolving that national emergency,” Greer said.He added, “It’s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought.”WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 29: U.S. President Donald Trump takes a question from a reporter before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on April 29, 2025 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageslive updatesTrump’s presidency: US officials tout progress in China trade talksCNN has asked the Treasury Department for clarification on the deal, though Bessent said details will be shared Monday morning. Ahead of the talks, Trump administration officials downplayed expectations that a deal would be reached this weekend, characterizing the meetings as a good first step. Bessent had suggested last week that his goal was de-escalation of tensions, as the US and China have been at avirtual stalematesince Trump imposed his tariff policy.“These are very tough negotiators,” Greer said of his Chinese counterparts, saying the group “worked very diligently” and the last two days were “very constructive.”Bessent said he and Greer, who did not take questions from the press, have briefed Trump, who he described as “fully informed.”Trump indicated ahead of the talks that he was willing to lower the tariff rate on China to 80%, saying in a post to social media that it was “up to Scott B.,” referring to Bessent. The White House later clarified that China also needed to make concessions.The US and China made “substantial progress” and reached an “important consensus” in their trade talks, Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng said Sunday.He described the discussions as “candid, in-depth and constructive,” saying both sides agreed to establish a “trade consultation mechanism” and would conduct further consultations.“China and the United States will finalize the relevant details as soon as possible and will issue a joint statement reached at the talks on May 12,” a readout from the Chinese delegation said.The weekend talks marked a significant step toward thawing US-China trade relations.The current 145% tariff rate has sent shipments from China into the United Statesplunging by 60%, according to Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker.Even reducing that tariff rate by half might not be enough to change trade levels significantly. Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the two countries.The combination of fewer goods coming in and increased costs on imports that do arrive has already started pushing up prices for Americans. Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday that a key measure of inflation would effectively double to 4% by the year’s end because of Trump’s trade war.Andwith ships carrying goods under the 145% tariffsnow coming into port, a trade deal wouldn’t lower prices immediately.CNNRelated articleTrump to accept luxury jet from Qatar to use as Air Force OneTo say Americans depend on a wide range of Chinese goods understates how pervasive those goods have become in all our lives. Footwear, clothes, appliances, microchips, baby goods, toys, sports equipment, office machine parts and much more all pour into the United States from China in staggering numbers.But now those imports are decreasing. Imports into the United States during the second half of 2025 are expected to fall at least 20% year over year, according to the National Retail Federation. The decline from China will be even starker: JPMorgan expects a 75% to 80% drop in imports from there.The trade war has already affected the US economy. The nation’sgross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed America’s first quarterly contraction since early 2022, as importers raced to bring in goods before punishing tariff rates kicked in.The impact of the sky-high tariffs is also being felt keenly in China, whose exports to the US fell sharply in April. Chinese outbound shipments to the US stood at$33 billionlast month — a whopping 21% decline from the$41.8 billionrecorded in April 2024, according to CNN’s calculation.Steep US tariffs also took a heavy toll on China’s manufacturing sector. Chinese factory activitycontracted at its fastest pacein 16 months in April, adding urgency to Beijing’s efforts to roll out fresh economic stimulus.The news that Bessent and Greer would meet their Chinese counterparts in Geneva raised hopes of a thaw between the two nations. The US and China are the world’s largest and second-largest economies, respectively, bigger than even the next 20 economies put together,according to World Bank data.Trump also told a conservative radio host on Wednesday that he wouldraise the caseof jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai “as part of the negotiation.” Lai, a pugnacious former publisher whose now-shuttered tabloid Apple Daily was a regular thorn in Beijing’s side, is in the midst of a national security trial that could send him to prison for life.It’s unclear whether US officials brought up Lai in talks with their Chinese counterparts.This story has been updated with additional details.CNN’s David Goldman, Nathaniel Meyersohn, Shawn Deng and Michael Rios contributed to this report.",

Butindigenous tribesvary in how they refer to the silvery orb during this time of year. The Creek and Choctaw people both refer to it as the mulberry moon, while the Cree call it the frog moon. The Anishnaabe tribe knows it as the blossom moon, and the Apache refer to this moon rising during the “season when the leaves are green.”Upcoming full moonsFollowing the final micromoon of the year, there are seven more full moons to look out for in 2025, with supermoons occurring in October, November and December.Here’s the list of full moons remaining in 2025, according to theFarmers’ Almanac:June      11: Strawberry moonJuly      10: Buck moonAugust      9: Sturgeon moonSeptember      7: Corn moonOctober      6: Harvest moonNovember      5: Beaver moonDecember      4: Cold moonLunar and solar eclipses in 2025In the lead-up to the fall season, twoeclipse eventswill grace the sky.A total lunar eclipse will be most visible from Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, parts of eastern South America, Alaska and Antarctica on September 7 and 8, according toTime and Date.A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when Earth is between the sun and moon and the three celestial objects line up in a row so that the moon passes into our planet’s shadow.iStockRelated articleHere’s everything you could possibly need to become an amateur stargazer (Courtesy CNN Underscored)When the moon is within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, it takes on a reddish hue, which has led to the nickname “blood moon” for a lunar eclipse, according to NASA. That shadow isn’t perfect, so sunbeams sneak around the shadow’s edges, bathing the moon in warm hues.A partial solar eclipse will occur on September 21 as the moon moves between the sun and Earth but the celestial bodies aren’t perfectly aligned, according to NASA. In this type of event, the moon only blocks part of the sun’s face, creating a crescent shape in which it appears the moon is taking a “bite” out of the sun. This event will be visible to more remote areas of Australia, Antarctica and the Pacific Ocean.",

      "content": "CNN—Three Democratic lawmakers who were involved in a tense encounter outside an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement facility in Newark, New Jersey, are accusing the administration of “intimidation” after a Department of Homeland Security official suggested they could be arrested.Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, who joined CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday alongside fellow New Jersey Democrats, Reps. LaMonica McIver and Robert Menendez Jr., said the lawmakers haven’t heard from DHS after the tense encounter on Friday that culminated in thedetention of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.“We have no idea what they have in mind, other than to create an environment of intimidation just by claiming that perhaps we might be subject to arrest,” Watson Coleman said. “Nothing happened other than the chaos that they created themselves.”The lawmakers traveled for a tour of the facility as part of their Congressional oversight duties and had been there for nearly two hours before the confrontation as ICE officials gave them “the run around,” Watson Coleman said. But the situation escalated when Baraka was asked to leave the premises and was detained. He was released after several hours.The immigration officials eventually took the lawmakers on the tour after the confrontation, McIver said.“They took us on a tour, offered us a soda in the midst of doing this, never apologized or said anything about the confrontation and the chaos that they caused outside,” McIver said, adding that the lawmakers were able to speak to detainees while inside.Lawmakers are allowed to enter “any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens” to conduct oversight under the annual appropriations act, which allocates funds for federal agencies.Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., speaks with an officer demanding she be let into the ICE Detention office after the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Friday, May 9, 2025, in Newark, N.J.Angelina Katsanis/APBut DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN on Saturday the lawmakers could be arrested, saying the department has “body camera footage of some of these members of Congress assaulting our ICE enforcement officers, including body slamming a female ICE officer.”The videos released by the department show the arrest of Baraka, along with more angles of the physical altercations between federal agents, protesters and the members of Congress. One video appears to show McIver using her body to push past federal agents to follow Baraka after he was placed in handcuffs and moved behind the chain-linked fence. McIver on Sunday denied that she body slammed the agents.“There’s no video that supports me body slamming anyone,” she said, later adding that she hopes all the body camera video from the incident is released because it was a “very tense situation.”Watson Coleman on Sunday said the incident is an example of the Trump administration weaponizing law enforcement.“If they can do this to three federally elected officials with the authority to come and do their job, and they can then also lock up the mayor of the largest city in the state of New Jersey, who is on public property, I understand the fear that I keep getting information on,” Watson Coleman said. “People just are afraid of this un-American hyperactivity, this weaponization of law enforcement and the consistent lying at all levels to try to cover up for the wrong and the unlawful activities that ICE did on that day.”",

      "content": "People in entertainmentBeyoncéSee all topicsFacebookTweetEmailLinkLink Copied!FollowTina Knowles remembers growing up in a loving and raucous family of nine. She was the youngest of seven children. Add in her cousins, and they were a force to be reckoned with whenever they left the house.At a very early age, Knowles says she was taught not to draw any attention to herself. “Pretty is as pretty does,” her mom used to say.In other words, be quiet, know your place.Lucky for us all, she didn’t listen. On a book tour for her new memoir, “Matriarch,” an Oprah’s Book Club selection, she talked to me at CNN’s offices in New York about what she learned from her own childhood and her choices while raising her daughters, Beyoncé and Solange Knowles.CNNOn Mother’s Day weekend, here’s what the businesswoman, fashion designer and mother of two of the most famous entertainers in the world wanted to share.Don’t limit your childrenTeaching kids to be seen and not heard was a common way of parenting back when “Mama Tina” was growing up in Galveston, Texas, during segregation. Her mom, her teachers at her Catholic school and all the adults around her made clear what role she was expected to play.To Knowles, that translated into trying to make herself small and insignificant — even though she was born with a big personality, big feelings and many opinions. But Knowles simply couldn’t follow the quiet rule and was quickly given a nickname: “Badass TenieB.”“That was not a term of endearment when I was little,” Knowles told me in a recent conversation. “They used to just say, here comes that Badass TenieB because I was hyper, I talked back.” Now, she says she recognizes her willfulness and hyper behavior stemmed from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, orADHD. Which, she reflects, “wasn’t a thing then.”As a child, Tina Knowles attended Catholic school, where she had teachers who negatively shaped her view of school.Courtesy Tina Knowles/Penguin Random HouseKnowles attended a school where nuns ruled the roost. She said there were teachers who told her she didn’t belong, that she was unsalvageable and a bad seed. The words punctured her soul and made her hate going to school.“They thought they were doing the best thing,” Knowles said, but it hurt terribly.She would run home to tell her mother and could not understand why her mom would never take her side. She didn’t know her mother was working herself to the bone for the church to get Knowles and her siblings an education.From her own experience at school and in her childhood community, Knowles said it’s so important to really think about what you are saying to children. Labels can affect them for a lifetime.Related articleSanta Claus putting gifts under the christmas tree at nightNastco/iStockphoto/Getty ImagesUse positive reinforcement instead of threats for your child’s misbehavior, experts say“I still fight with that sometimes,” she said, “and I’m 71 years old. It’s in the back of my head: Don’t bring too much attention to yourself. It’s OK if somebody else takes credit for what you did.”Those words still cut, so she advises parents to do things differently. “Advocate for your kids. You have to protect your kids,” Knowles said. “Make sure that the messages that they’re giving your kids are ones that they can do anything they want to do and they do belong anywhere that they want to be.”It’s exactly the message she imparted to her girls.Pay attention to how you treat yourselfKnowles is a talented seamstress who continues to follow fashion. Here, wearing Gucci, she attends the 2024 LACMA Art+Film Gala in Los Angeles on November 2, 2024.Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty ImagesYour children are watching how you treat yourself, Knowles told me, noting that her loving mother, Agnéz Beyincé, lived life in fear for her children as she tried to make sure they were not targets in the segregated US South.But Knowles also watched her mother make exquisite outfits for all of her kids, and they were the best-dressed kids in town even though they were poor. (Knowles learned great lessons from her mother’s work as a seamstress and ended up creating most of the outfits for Destiny’s Child, Beyonce’s singing group with Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.)“As poor as we were, we were always the sharpest kids and just took a lot of pride in fashion and how we looked and … I think it helped us not to know how poor we were,” Knowles said. “I passed it on to my daughters … they’re very talented at putting things together. They don’t sew like I sew but they can put a button on, and they can put a hem in and take a dart in and that type of thing.”Work against sibling rivalryKnowles says she knew right away that Beyoncé had found her life’s passion the first time she saw her daughter onstage. It was that obvious. But Knowles said her younger daughter could have done anything, and she didn’t really want Solange to go into the music business.Solange (L) and Beyoncé perform onstage during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 21, 2018.Kevin Mazur/Getty Images“I was terrified when Beyoncé turned around 10,” said Knowles, worried she’d lose her children to their craft and that the work would create a wedge between the sisters.According to Knowles, the kids in Beyoncé’s singing group would say to Solange every day, “‘Be quiet, Solange,’ because she would try to choreograph (the group). You know she’s bossy, and she wanted to be involved.”“I started noticing that Beyoncé would allow them to talk to her like that,” she said. “I saw a wall between them coming, and so I got them in therapy.”While her family and community thought therapy could be problematic or even dangerous, she found a “wonderful” child therapist. As a result, the two sisters “are now as close as they can be. No wedge will come between them.”Knowles encourages other parents to do the same if they see an unhealthy sibling rivalry developing between your children.Get screened for breast cancerKnowles got diagnosed with breast cancer last year, and she struggled with the decision to mention it publicly or not. She decided to speak out so other people would also get screened, especially if they’ve missed a checkup or two or more.“You get busy doing everything for everyone else,” she said, “and everything else takes a priority over your health at some point in our lives, I think (for) women in particular, but men as well.”“I want to share it in hopes that that women would take a minute and say … I’m gonna go,” she added.",

      "content": "Abu Dhabi, UAECNN—Three energy-rich Gulf Arab nations are racing to turn their influence over Donald Trump into tangible gains with the president set to visit this week.They have built personal ties with the president and collectively pledged trillions in US investments while casting themselves as key intermediaries in conflicts Trump wants to resolve, from Gaza to Ukraine and Iran.Now, they’re being rewarded with the privilege of hosting Trump’s first state visit of his second term. The US president is set to land in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, followed by visits to Qatar and then the United Arab Emirates that stretch until May 16.Given Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy, the three states have much to offer.Ahead of Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East, analyst Firas Maksad looks at the what the U.S. president may accomplish on his trip, and tells Becky Anderson why he thinks the prospect of Saudi-Israeli normalization is dead.Clipped From VideovideoRelated videoMiddle East analyst discusses what to expect from the U.S. President’s visit to the region“In Trump’s book, the Gulf states tick all the right boxes,” Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, told CNN. They “pledge to invest trillions in the US economy and spend colossal amounts on US weapons systems.”Behind this carefully crafted strategy of wooing Trump is a desire from Gulf states to solidify and formalize their positions as the US’ indispensable security and economic partners, and extract as much benefit for themselves as they can.US-Gulf relations have improved significantly since Trump returned to office. Frustrated at the perceived lack of US interest in their needs under the Biden administration,Saudi Arabiaandthe UAEhad sought to diversify their military, technological and economic ties. With Trump in office, they see what one Gulf official called a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to achieve his country’s objectives.From their perspective, now is the time to cement ties with Washington, and even “secure greater privileges in their relationship with the world’s most powerful nation,” Ebtesam AlKetbi, founder and president of the Emirates Policy Center think tank in Abu Dhabi, said.Each of the three nations Trump is visiting has its own list of priorities. Here’s what they want from the US and how they’re going about achieving it.Sealing a US-Saudi security pact“Security, security and security” is what Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states seek most from Trump’s visit, said Ali Shihabi, an author and commentator on the politics and economics of Saudi Arabia.“Gulf States are looking for reassurance of the US security commitment to the Gulf’s stability,” Shihabi told CNN. “Trump has many priorities and has been known to lose interest quickly … and they want to keep him engaged.”Last year, the US and Saudi Arabiacame close to finalizinga landmark defense and trade pact – but the deal stalled over Saudi insistence that Israel commit to a path toward Palestinian statehood.Firas Maksad, managing director for the Middle East and North Africa at Eurasia Group, told CNN’s Becky Anderson that Trump is likely to move ahead with major deals regardless of normalization, which he said is “dead.”General view of Aramco's oil field in the Empty Quarter, Shaybah, Saudi Arabia, on January 12, 2024.Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersRiyadh is also seeking US cooperation to develop a civil nuclear program, but that has been held up over its insistence on enriching uranium domestically – raising concerns in the US and Israel over nuclear weapons proliferation. Uranium, when enriched to high levels, can be used to produce nuclear weapons.Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman looks on during a meeting in Riyadh on October 23, 2024.Nathan Howard/Pool/AFP/Getty Images/FileRelated articleWhy is Saudi Arabia hosting talks to end the Ukraine war?White House backing for a Saudi nuclear program could see American firms win lucrative contracts.Riyadh appears to be framing its relationship with the US as a win-win. In March, Trump said he’d go to Saudi Arabia if it invests $1 trillion in the US. “They’ve agreed to do that, so I’m going to be going there,” he said.While Saudi Arabia didn’t confirm that figure, it announced plans in January to expand trade and investment with the US by $600 billion over four years,with potential for more.But for Riyadh to diversify away from oil, it still needs to sell oil – at a healthy profit – to fund that transition. Recent price drops, driven in part by Trump’s tariffs, threaten to undermine those ambitions. Trump has made clear he wants oil prices lower, putting him at odds with Saudi Arabia’s need for high revenues to finance its economic transformation.UAE’s quest for AI dominancePerhaps more than any other Gulf state, the UAE sees investment as central to its strategy for deepening ties with the US and securing returns – and it has money to back it up. Among the world’s richest countries per capita, it has pledged trillions in US investments. Abu Dhabi has even branded itself “the capital of capital.”“Expanding trade and investment is a way to reinforce this strategic partnership,” AlKetbi said. “The US remains a critical security guarantor for the Gulf region, while also offering a dynamic economy full of opportunities and capabilities that align with the long-term Gulf development plans.”Residential and commercial skyscrapers on the skyline of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on April 10, 2022.Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesIn March, the UAE announced a $1.4 trillion investment plan over 10 years focused on AI, semiconductors, manufacturing, and energy. Its existing US investments alreadytotal $1 trillion, according to its embassy in Washington.GAIN Summit, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, September 2024CNNRelated articleWhy these Gulf states want to be AI superpowers“The UAE sees a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become a significant contributor in AI and advanced technology,” Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, told CNN. “The commitment to invest $1.4 trillion… aligns with the UAE’s goal to diversify its economy away from its over reliance on hydrocarbons to ensure prosperity for the country in the future.”But it won’t be easy for Abu Dhabi to achieve its stated goal of becoming a global leader in AI by 2031 without advanced American microchips.During the final days of former President Joe Biden’s administration, the US tightened curbs on AI exports to keep advanced technology out of the hands of foreign adversaries like China, which were meant to take effect on May 15. The UAE has been one of the countries facing restrictions and may expect them to be lifted during Trump’s trip.On Thursday, the US announced thatTrump will rescinda set of the Biden-era curbs.Qatar’s global diplomacyQatar is the Gulf Arab nation with the most formalized security ties with the US. It hosts the biggest US military installation in the Middle East, which the State Department describes as “indispensable” for US military operations in the region.Last year, the USquietly reached an agreementthat extends its military presence at the sprawling base in Qatar for another 10 years. Italso amendeda 1992 defense cooperation agreement with the US, which is meant to further strengthen their security partnership.In 2022, the Biden administration also designated Qatar as a Major Non-NATO Ally, a title granted to close friends that have strategic working relationships with the US military.Qatar has been a key mediator in a number of conflicts – from the war in Gaza to Afghanistan. Experts say it is part of an effort to remain relevant in the eyes of Washington.A US military transport aircraft, which was set to carry humanitarian aid parcels for the Gaza Strip, is pictured on the tarmac at the Al-Udeid air base southwest of Doha on March 21, 2024.Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images“The Gulf states view conflict mediation as a source of influence and prestige,” Alhasan told CNN. “They have managed to use their role as mediators to position themselves as indispensable partners for Trump’s political agenda.”Doha also maintains close ties with Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has been on a quest to relieve his country of years-long sanctions by the West.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani attend a meeting in Lusail, Qatar, Friday Oct. 13, 2023.

Doha is pushing the Trump administration to lift sanctions on Syriaunder the Caesar Act, the official said, adding that Qatar is wary about providing any financial support to Syria without Washington’s blessing.Trump’s visit is ultimately about what he can get out of the three Gulf states, experts said, adding that each of the three nations is anticipating a set of new deals that will benefit both parties.“He’s coming here because he believes it is in the interest of the US economy, perhaps his interest and those around him, to have those deals here with Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar,” Maksad said. “So expect big announcements.”CNN’s Becky Anderson, Salma Arafa and Tala Alrajjal contributed reporting.",

      "content": "CNN—People aren’t friending each other as much on Facebook these days. The iPhone might  not feel necessary in a decade. And Google searches on one of the world’s most popular smartphones are declining.Those were some of the unusually frank admissions from two separate antitrust trials against Meta and Google. It was a rare acknowledgement from tech leaders that the once-cutting edge products their companies were founded on could someday lose their relevance.Silicon Valley prides itself on innovation, change and a constant quest to find “the next big thing.” The race for relevance is a constant one.Still, the admissionsunderscore the mounting pressure tech giants face amid new threats from artificial intelligence and new social media apps – and how quickly any product can get left behind.Apple did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. A Google spokesperson pointed to the company’spublic statements, while a Meta spokesperson directed CNN to specific responses from CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s courtroom testimony.The three tech giants helped shape the modern web over the last two decades.Google’s search enginetriumphed in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to its system of ranking results by relevance and importance rather than sorting them by topic.And Meta, Facebook’s parent company, is largely responsible for turning social platforms into an addictive feed of likes, comments and other interactions.Fueling both of those trends was the smartphone, allowing users to access these services from almost anywhere, which Apple set the stage for with the first iPhone in 2007.The success of those products catapulted Apple, Google and Meta to mega-valuations. But during courtroom testimony, executives indicated consumers are losing interest in some of the very tasks Facebook and Google were initially built for.Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, revealed last week that Google search queries on its devices decreased for the first time last month, according toBloomberg. The comments came during his testimony in the Justice Department’s antitrust trial against Google. (Google pays Apple to be the default search engine in the iPhone maker’s Safari browser.)It’s another sign that consumers may be shifting to AI chatbots to fulfill some of the duties of a traditional search engine. Market research firmGartnerestimated last year that search engine volume would drop 25% by 2026 as consumers gravitate toward AI tools.Google said in astatementon Wednesday that it continues “to see overall query growth in search,” and that includes “an increase in total queries coming from Apple’s devices and platforms.”Meta, too, is seeing consumers shift away from its original use case: adding friends and sharing content.“The amount that people are sharing with friends on Facebook, especially, has been declining,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergsaid during an April trialfor an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission. “Even the amount of new friends that people add … I think has been declining. But I don’t know the exact numbers.”Instead, Zuckerberg said the company has seen a big boost in direct messages.Zuckerberg’s comments come as research showsFacebook is falling behind other online platforms with younger crowds. APew Research Center reportfrom December found that Facebook usage has dropped off over the last 10 years, with just 32% of teens saying they use what was previously Meta’s namesake social network. That compares to 71% in 2014 and 2015, although teens still use Instagram frequently.Meta has aggressively shaped its apps to keep up with new trends. In 2013, Facebook failed tobuy Snapchat, but about three years later itintroduced its own alternative in Instagram Stories.Instagram’s short-form video feed, known as Reels, came to take on TikTokin 2020, and Zuckerberg said in his testimony that video content is where people are spending most of their time on Facebook these days.Even the iPhone may be at risk of losing favorover the next decade, an Apple executive said.“You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now, as crazy as it sounds,” Apple’s Cue said during his courtroom testimony in the Google trial, according toBloomberg.With 19% of global smartphoneshipments in the first quarter of 2025, according to theInternational Data Corporation, Apple’s iPhone is the world’s second most popular smartphone brand.But Apple, along with other tech behemoths, is determined to figure out what comes next.And the answer could be smart glasses that use AI to analyze the world around you to execute tasks without reaching for your phone — a vision that Meta, Samsung and Google are already betting on. Zuckerberg said in his testimony that he believes consumers will eventually interact with content through “smart glasses and holograms,” removing the need to use a “glowing rectangle” to access digital platforms. Amazon’s head of devices and services Panos Panay also didn’t rule out the possibility of camera-equipped Alexa glasses similar to those offered by Meta in a FebruaryCNN interview.Liza-Bart Carroll wears Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses during the Second Annual White House Correspondents' Weekend TGAIFriday Lunch hosted by The Washington AI Network at The House at 1229 on April 25 in Washington, DC.Paul Morigi/Getty ImagesApple, too, believes the next step in computing will involve devices worn on the face, as evidenced by the $3,500 Vision Pro. That device, while niche, could be a precursor to the types of smart glasses Apple’s rivals are working on or currently selling.At the same time, consumers aren’t upgrading their phones as frequently now that mobile devices no longer dramatically change each year.For now, consumers will continue scrolling through Instagram and typing Google Search queries on their iPhones. And change is a good thing for corporate giants like these; it lets them show Wall Street there’s still room to grow while boosting their arguments to lawmakers that they face stiff competition.What’s changing, though, is that the tech companies that ruled the early 2000s and 2010s may have to fight a bit harder to stay ahead of the curve.",

      "content": "CNN—For a fortnight every May, Cannes hosts more stars than there are in heaven (or the old MGM backlot). This year the French film festival will be even glitzier than usual as a who’s-who of Hollywood talent descends on the Côte d’Azur to rub shoulders with the great and good of the international film community.All signs point to a stellar year for Cannes, riding high off a strong showing at the Academy Awards, with filmmakers queuing up to hit the red carpet and risk the barbs of sleep-deprived critics.The US contingent at the festival, which begins Tuesday, is large. Tom Cruise returns to Cannes three years after “Top Gun: Maverick” with “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” hoping to repeat the winning formula that propelled “Maverick” to a billion dollars at the box office. No honorary Palme d’Or for Cruise this time though; instead, that will be handed to Cannes habitué Robert De Niro, a year shy of the 50th anniversary of “Taxi Driver” winning the Palme d’Or. Spike Lee, who served as jury president in 2021 (not without incident) will also return with “Highest 2 Lowest,” his riff on Akira Kurosawa’s “High To Low” (1963), starring Denzel Washington as a music mogul targeted with a ransom plot.Spike Lee, who took on jury president duties at Cannes in 2021, returns this year with new film \"Highest 2 Lowest.\"Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images EuropeTom Cruise attends the gala screening of \"Top Gun: Maverick\" at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2022.Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images Europe“Highest 2 Lowest” will play out of competition alongside Ethan Coen comedy “Honey Don’t!,” his follow up to last year’s “Drive Away Dolls,” the second title in his so-called “lesbian B-movie trilogy.” Whether it’s simply a case of a stacked lineup, or quibbles overtheatrical windows and French law(Lee’s film will hit Apple TV+ in September, presumably nixing any chance of a cinema release in France), it’s a sign of the festival’s rude health that these Cannes heavyweights aren’t duking it out for a Palme d’Or.So, who is? Competition for the top prize signals a changing of the guard. Some Cannes stalwarts remain: two-time Palme winners the Dardennes brothers of Belgium with “Young Mothers,” Ukrainian Sergei Loznitsa with “Two Prosecutors,” and Scotland’s Lynne Ramsay (“We Need To Talk About Kevin,” “You Were Never Really Here”), whose adaptation of Ariana Harwicz’s novel “Die, My Love” stars Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson. Wes Anderson will also be in competition for the fourth time with “The Phoenician Scheme,” featuring some of his usual players (Bill Murray, Jeffrey Wright) and some delightful new additions (Riz Ahmed, Mia Threapleton, daughter of Kate Winslet). Add castmates Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Benicio Del Toro, Willem Dafoe and more and you’ve got the starriest red carpet of the festival.Tom Cruise hangs on for dear life as Ethan Hunt in \"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning.\"Skydance/Paramount Pictures and Skydance\"Sentimental Value,\" directed by Joachim Trier, reunites the director with actress Renate Reinsve.Kasper Tuxen /MUBIJoaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal star in \"Eddington,\" directed by Ari Aster.A24Joachim Trier, who rose through the ranks at Cannes before bursting into the mainstream with multi-Oscar nominee“The Worst Person in the World”(2021) reunites with lead Renate Reinsve for the highly-anticipated “Sentimental Value,” which also stars Stellan Skarsgård. Iranian auteur Jafar Panahi,whose 2011 film “This Is Not A Film” was smuggled to the festival on a USB stick hidden inside a cake, will be back in competition with “A Simple Accident,” his follow up to 2022’s “No Bears,” which won top prize at the Venice Film Festival. So too American indie queen Kelly Reichardt, last at Cannes with“Showing Up”and now debuting “The Mastermind,” a period heist drama led by Josh O’Connor, who stars in two competition films – the other being “The History of Sound,” directed by South African Oliver Hermanus and co-led by Paul Mescal.Hermanus is one of a slew of competition newcomers, including Spaniard Carla Simón, a Berlinale winner in 2022, debuting “Romería,” and German director Mascha Schilinski with “Sound of Falling.” The latter, previously titled “The Doctor Says I’m Alright, But I’m Feeling Blue,” follows four generations of women united by trauma, and has trailed significant buzz for months leading to the festival – even more notable given Schilinski’s low profile.Reichardt, Ramsay, Simón and Schilinski are four of seven women directors nominated for the Palme this year – a third of the competition total and a positive step in the festival’s quest for better gender representation. None are following up a Palme d’Or win like Julia Ducournau, though. Ducournau’s“Titane”triumphed in 2021 and she returns with “Alpha,” reportedly a body horror set against an AIDS epidemic. Already bought by NEON, audiences should expect another provocative film.Speaking of, Ari Aster (“Hereditary,” “Midsommar”) is making his Cannes bow with “Eddington.” Bearinga poster alluding to the AIDS crisis of the 1980sand rumored to be set during the Covid-19 pandemic, the movie reunites Aster with his“Beau Is Afraid”star Joaquin Phoenix as a New Mexico sheriff in a standoff with Pedro Pascal’s mayor.The Palme d’Or jury, led by French actress Juliette Binoche and featuring Halle Berry and “Succession” actor Jeremy Strong, will be watching the field of 22 films and will announce a winner on May 24.Talk of the townElsewhere at the festival, actors are stepping behind the camera. In the Un Certain Regard category for rising filmmakers, Kristen Stewart directs Imogen Poots in “The Chronology of Water,” an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch’s memoir. Scarlett Johansson’s “Eleanor The Great” stars June Squibb, and Harris Dickinson – last seen seducing Nicole Kidman in “Babygirl” – writes and directs “Urchin,” set on the streets of London. Also notable in Un Certain Regard is hot title “My Father’s Shadow,” thought to be the first-ever Nigerian film in Cannes’ official selection.\"Eleanor The Great\" stars June Squibb and is directed by Scarlett Johnasson.Sony Picture Classics\"The Chronology of Water\" is Kristen Stewart's directorial debut feature.CG Cinema\"My Father's Shadow\" stars Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù (center) as a father who brings his two sons into Lagos in the aftermath of the 1993 Nigerian election.MUBIThe festival has never hesitated to program films covering ongoing global events, and the Israel-Hamas war will be referenced on screen. Israeli director Nadav Lapid will bring his brand of social satire to the Directors’ Fortnight with“Yes!,”a film set in the aftermath of theOctober 7 attacks. Meanwhile,“Put Your Soul On Your Hand And Walk,”by Iranian filmmaker Sepideh Farsi, screens in the ACID section and profiles war documentarian Fatima Hassouna. The film is already being viewed in a new light after Hassouna, who had covered the conflict on the ground in Gaza,was killed in an Israeli strike the day after the festival announced its lineup.There’s a heavy dose of reality behind the scenes too. Taking a step back from the premieres, Cannes’ busy film market will likely be discussing whetherPresident Donald Trump’s announcement that he intends to introduce tariffs on films “produced in Foreign Lands”will come to pass – and if so, how it could be implemented.The award season kingmakerLate-breaking US policy announcements aside, Cannes is swaggering into its latest edition. The festival screened close to 3,000 films to curate its official selection, and programmers shoehorned big name after big name into its lineup right up to the eleventh hour. A lot would have to go wrong for 2025notto be a vintage year.Whisper it quietly, but it’s been quite the turnaround. For much of the aughts, Cannes was locked in a not-so Cold War with the Venice Film Festival over who could bag the most exciting titles. Cannes was fighting with one hand tied behind its back; Venice had – has – an open-door policy to the big-spending streamers, while Cannes said “non” to including them in its competition lineup. Quickly, Venice became seen as the starting gun for awards season.But then Cannes had a notable win with Bong Joon Ho’s“Parasite,”the 2019 Palme d’Or winner and winner of best picture at the Academy Awards in 2020 – the first non-English language best picture winner, and the first film to achieve the Cannes-Oscar double since “Marty” in 1955. The festival, a champion of world cinema, which normally positions itself above the insular tastes of the Academy, knew the significance of the moment. It was a win-win, repositioning Cannes in the Oscars conversation without having to compromise the festival’s mission.US director Sean Baker poses with the Palme d'Or for the film \"Anora\" at the Cannes Film Festival on May 25, 2024.SAMEER AL-DOUMY/AFP via Getty ImagesBaker holds Oscar statuettes for best picture, best director, best film editing and best original screenplay for “Anora” at the 97th Oscars on March 2, 2025.Mike Coppola/Getty ImagesSince then, Cannes has been on an Oscars roll (no doubt aided by the internationalization of the Academy). Including “Parasite,” four of the last five Palme d’Or winners have been best picture nominees. Oscar-winners “Anatomy of a Fall” and “The Zone of Interest” premiered at Cannes in 2023, while last year’s edition featured “The Substance,” “Emilia Perez,” “Flow” and “Anora,” which swept the Academy Awards and achieved the best picture and Palme d’Or double. Cannes will never need the Oscars, but the validation doesn’t hurt.For all the glamor and its A-list guests, the festival’s greatest asset is its ability to pluck a hit from nowhere and set a director and their movie on a dizzying trajectory. What will break out in 2025? We don’t know yet – and that’s why it’s all so exciting.﻿The Cannes Film Festival runs from May 13-24.",

      "content": "CNN—It may be no surprise that President Donald Trump, who did not serve in the active-duty military, would rather celebrate victory than veterans.Inmultiplesocial mediapoststhis month, Trump said he would declare November 11 as Victory Day for World War I. He didn’t mention that it’s already a federal holiday: Veterans Day.In a similar vein, Trump wants a military parade that could costtens of millions of dollarsto celebrate the US Army’s 250th birthday, which so happens to fall on his birthday, June 14. It’s alsoFlag Day, when the Continental Congress adopted the American flag.“I view it for Flag Day, not necessarily my birthday,”Trump told NBC Newsin a recent interview. “Somebody put it together.”It could be the same kind of coincidence by which the expensive new fighter jet the Pentagon is developing will be the F-47 and Trump is the 47th president.ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA - NOVEMBER 11: The Washington Monument is visible through grave stones at Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day on November 11, 2024 in Arlington, Virginia. Veterans Day is held on the anniversary of the end of World War I and honors all veterans of the US Armed Forces. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesRelated articleTrump says he wants to rename Veterans Day to ‘Victory Day for World War I’Nobody at the White House appears to have put together that the day Trump wants to celebrateVictory in World War II Day, May 8, when Germany surrendered in Europe, was not the end of World War II. Americans continued fighting and dying in the Pacific theater until August, when the US dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.Trump said it’s important for the US to celebrate these days. It sounds quite similar toVictory Day in Russia, a cringe-worthy idea for anyone who does not want to put the US government alongside Russia’s. But on the other hand, the president is not calling for full-on federal holidays. There are too many already, he said. (It would also take an act of Congress.)The rhetorical idea of superimposing a celebration of victory over veterans is noteworthy.It’s quite the evolution for a holiday that used to commemorate armistice when it was first observedby Woodrow Wilson in 1919, a year after the truce that ended the war:“To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations.”A few years later, in 1923, just before his death, a frail Wilson wouldchastise Americans in an Armistice Day radio addressfor turning toward isolationism and not joining the League of Nations, a sentiment still relevant today as Trump disrupts the post-World War II economic and diplomatic order.US President Donald Trump arrives for a 100th day rally in Warren, Michigan, US, on Tuesday, April 29, 2025.Sarah Rice/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesRelated articleArmy plans for a potential parade on Trump’s birthday call for 6,600 soldiersThe president most associated with that post-World War II order, Dwight Eisenhower, is also the one who proclaimed that Armistice Day shouldbecome Veterans Day.“Let us solemnly remember the sacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly, on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to preserve our heritage of freedom, and let us reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting an enduring peace so that their efforts shall not have been in vain,” Eisenhower wrote.He may be better remembered for a farewell speech warning of a military-industrial complex, which also echoes across history now that Trump, unlike Eisenhower, wants to parade military hardware through the nation’s capital.“We have the greatest missiles in the world,” Trump told NBC News. “We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we’re going to celebrate it.”",

      "content": "Federal agenciesDonald TrumpSee all topicsFacebookTweetEmailLinkLink Copied!FollowDespite itsreputation as ironclad, it was possible to escape Alcatraz. All it took was brains, guts and 50 raincoats.On June 11, 1962, three prisoners – Frank Morris and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, all in their 30s – shimmied with a homemade raft through hidden holes in theircell walls, climbed through a ventilation duct onto the roof and bolted from the island fortress into the freezing, choppy waters of the San Francisco Bay.The notion that the island prison is truly escape-proof is a key part of President Donald Trump’sproposalto reopen it more than 60 years after the Bureau of Prisons closed it for being too expensive to operate.“Nobody’s ever escaped from Alcatraz,” Trump asserted Monday in the Oval Office.From left to right, Frank Lee Morris, Clarence Anglin and John Anglin are seen in their mugshots.DOJ/ReutersBut while Morris and the Anglin brothers were never found, fans of outlaw drama – and some of the prisoners’ own family members – are convinced they actually made it to shore and lived out their lives hidden from justice and the public eye.“That case,” said Art Roderick, a retired US marshal involved in the investigation for nearly 40 years, “just never goes away.”Getting to Alcatraz, then getting outMorris and the Anglins ended up in America’s most foreboding prison for the most obvious reason: They were constantly trying to escape every other place they had been held, rap sheets in their FBI files show. Still, the federal complex in California known as The Rock broke neither their spirits nor their record.“Well, they didn’t like being locked up,” said David Widner, 58, who has cowrittena bookabout his uncles’ breakout.They also didn’t like being poor. The FBI documents show more than two dozen charges combined for the two brothers – who grew up in rural Georgia with a dozen other brothers and sisters – mostly for burglary and breaking and entering.“A lot of it was just so they would have nice things,” Widner said. “They wanted better things that they didn’t know how to go about getting other than stealing.”Related articleAlcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay on Sunday, May 4.Noah Berger/APTrump wants to reopen one of America’s most notorious prisons. Here’s how Alcatraz earned its reputationClarence and John’s last theft was of a tiny bank in Columbia, Alabama, the records show. They werearrestedfive days later – along with their older brother Alfred – on the run in Ohio, netting them 15-year federal prison sentences.The Anglins were transferred to Alcatraz following an escape attempt at thefederal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, which at the time was the largestmaximum-security prisonin the United States. Prison officials said Clarence tried to get out – with John’s help – by hiding inside two large metal breadboxes.Clarence only got as far as the prison bakery before being caught, FBI records show, but it was the kind of creative solution that didn’t surprise the Anglin family. As children, the boys once figured out how to reuse a punctured tire by packing the hole full of moss, Widner told CNN.When the Anglins were paired in adjoining cells at Alcatraz next to Morris – another prisoner sent to the Rock due to repeated escapes – another attempt seemed almost inevitable.Escape: Rubber coats, sharpened spoons and fake headsBased on the evidence they could gather, along with testimony from inmate Allen West – who was part of the conspiracy but said the three escapees left without him that night in 1962 – the Federal Bureau of Investigation pieced together an extraordinary plot accomplished slowly over six months:Rubber raincoats stolen from fellow inmates, glued together to make a raft – 6 feet by 14 feet – sealed with steam pipesA vacuum cleaner motor used to make an electric drillFiled-down spoons used as screwdriversA concertina, a musical instrument similar to an accordion – and one of the few items used the men didn’t steal – converted into a bellows to inflate the escape raft; Morris, who investigators said had an IQ of 133, bought it with $28.69 from his prison trust fundThe most ingenious part of the men’s plan may have been using cement fragments, cotton, hair fragments from the prison barber shop, glue and paint to create threedummy heads. The improvised sculptures were crude and grotesque but just realistic enough at a distance to fool the night guards into thinking the men were sound asleep in their beds.UNIVERSAL NEWSREEL“My mom and the brothers and sisters always said they were the modern-day MacGyvers,” Widner remembered, recalling theTV showabout a technical genius who uses found objects to construct whatever he needs to get out of tricky situations. “They could take nothing and make something out of it.”A re-creation of the cell once occupied by Alcatraz escapee Frank Morris is seen in 2003 at Alcatraz.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesInvestigators agreed, according to an FBI case memo filed three days after the escape. The “work which the subjects performed in preparation for the escape is fantastic,” Special Agent in Charge Frank L. Price said.Another factor working in the men’s favor was the prison’s deterioration. Plans were already underway to decommission the extraordinarily costly prison, according to Roderick, with Warden Olin Blackwell telling reporters it would take $5 million to get Alcatraz in proper condition, the equivalent today of $53 million.“They weren’t doing any repairs at the time,” the retired marshal said, and the Bureau of Prisons was struggling to keep the facility properly staffed. “You put all that together, and that’s how the escape occurred.”UNIVERSAL NEWSREELInvestigators found the men punched out holes in their cell walls by drilling them over weeks and covering their work with painted cardboard, FBI records show. Climbing up the pipes of a utility shaft, the inmates disassembled the ventilation covers, descended the roof on a chimney pipe and scaled a fence.Launching the raft they had designed with the help of a Sports Illustrated magazine, the three escaped into the frigid darkness, government files say.Intriguing clues soon turned up. But, somehow, they all seemed to go nowhere.“I have never in my life come across a case that has more of those types of leads,” Roderick said.Search: Boats, a copter and a postcardWithin hours of the escape, investigators scoured the waters around Alcatraz. State police were put on alert. The Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers contributed boats and a helicopter, FBI records show. Blackwell, the warden, even ordered a full search of Alcatraz on the off chance the men never actually left.A hundred soldiers and 35 military police combed Angel Island, the spot just north of Alcatraz where West told investigators the men planned to go. “No evidence was found to indicate the Escapees ever reached this island,” an FBI report says.“Of course, it became the hottest thing in the media at the time,” retired FBI agent John Arendsaidyears later. “We didn’t have cable news, but you had all the media very fascinated with this case.”Then, the first bit of evidence the guys might have survived appeared. But it did not wash up on shore. It arrived by mail.“HA HA WE MADE IT.”The postcard addressed to “Warden, Alcatraz Prison” turned up June 18, signed “Frank, Jim, Clarence,” each in a different hand.The FBI commissioned a handwriting expert, who determined the signature of “Clarence” was likely a forgery. There were not enough handwriting samples of John and Frank to make a comparison, and the FBI concluded the card was probably a hoax inspired by the intense and worldwide news coverage.UNIVERSAL NEWSREELWithin days, searchers skimming the waters near Alcatraz Island, with its crystal-clear view of the Golden Gate Bridge, found sparse evidence related to the escape, including a portion of one of their improvised oars and part of a homemade life jacket, FBI records show.Sealed packets made out of the same material as the raft contained personal photos of the Anglins and family addresses, as well as contact information for a San Francisco attorney who had defended Alcatraz inmates in the past, the files say. The attorney told the FBI he never heard from Morris or the Anglins.Sisters of the Anglin brothers, Marie Anglin Widner (right) and Mearl Anglin Taylor, visit Alcatraz in 2012 on the 50th anniversary of their brothers' escape.Liz Hafalia/San Francisco Chronicle/APThe government files contain dozens of contacts from people who said they may have seen the prisoners, but none ever panned out. They also include then-Director J. Edgar Hoover’s reluctance to reveal the information the bureau had to the public.“I trust our (San Francisco) Office isn’t giving (a) ‘blow by blow’ account to the press nor anyone else,” Hoover said in a June 13 memo. “Our job is to find these thugs, not keep them advised of our progress.”The Anglin family is convinced that, despite the FBI’s release of hundreds of pages of documents in the case, the agency is still reluctant to discuss the full story.“They know things they won’t tell because they couldn’t find them,” Widmer said.FBI: ‘They are presumed to be dead’Widner’s first encounter with his uncles’ story came in 1977, when four men from the FBI visited his home and asked his mother Marie if she had any information about where her brothers, Clarence and John Anglin, ended up, he said.“She told them no, and if she did (know), she wouldn’t tell them,” he said.Two years later, the FBI closed its investigation, saying it had never found any evidence Morris and the Anglin brothers survived the escape attempt. “They are presumed to be dead,” a 1979 memo stated.But the Marshals Service, which is responsible for capturing fugitives, has never closed its file. Wanted posters of the three remain on the service’s website, and the government even created computer-aged portraits showing how they believe the men would have appeared in their mid-80s.From left to right, Frank Lee Morris, Clarence Anglin and John William Anglin are seen in computer-aged portraits showing how the government believes the men would have appeared in their mid-80s.US Marshals Service“There have been actionable leads that have come in,” said Roderick, the retired marshal who continues to consult on the case.Alleged proof of life keeps resurfacingThe assumption that Morris and the Anglin brothers could not have possibly survived the tricky tides and freezing cold spray of the San Francisco Bay took a hit in 2003 from an unlikely source: reality TV. The Discovery Channel science program “MythBusters” launched its own raincoat raft from Alcatraz, matching the tools and circumstances of the 1962 escape as closely as possible. (Discovery and CNN share the same parent company.)Following the bay’s currents west toward the Golden Gate Bridge instead of the long-assumed path north toward Angel Island, hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hynemansuccessfully landedat the Marin Headlands in their homemade watercraft, saying the three men’s survival was “entirely possible.”A decade later,Dutch scientistsusingcomputer models of currents in the Bayfound the brothers and Morris could have made it safely to the Golden Gate Bridge area if they had left between 11 p.m. and midnight. Prison officials believed the men escaped between 10:30 and 11 p.m., they told the FBI.A bird flies this month above Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay in California.Noah Berger/APThe changing tides would then have sent any debris related to their trek back toward Angel Island, the researchers found. “We don’t know how good they were at paddling, but I suppose if you ever have energy to spare, it would be in that situation,”saidstudy co-author Rolf Hut at the Delft University of Technology.More than 40 years after the FBI turned over the investigation to the Marshals Service, leads continue to surface. The Anglin family says it got a photo from a family friend purportedly showing the brothers in Brazil in 1975, something the Marshals Service has said is impossible to verify.In 2013, the FBI got a letter that claimed to be from John Anglin, CNN affiliate KPIXreported. The writer said he would be willing to turn himself in if he was publicly promised cancer treatment and a one-year prison sentence.Even relatives who believe the inmates survived their escape acknowledge the men – who would now all be in their 90s – are almost certainly no longer around to be found.“They either died in the Bay or are dead by now,” Roderick said.Past raises questions of prison’s futureThe dramatic 1962 disappearance – which inspired the 1979 Clint Eastwood movie, “Escape from Alcatraz” – seemed to harden the resolve of then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy that Alcatraz had outlived its usefulness, telling reporters he was committing to closing it.“Kennedy does not agree with the view that Alcatraz should be retained as a deterent (sic) to hardened criminals in that other institutions could fill the same role at less expense,” stated an FBI memo, citing a story in the San Francisco Chronicle.Alcatraz was shuttered for good the following year, remaining dormant until the National Park Service began converting it into a museum in 1972. Since then, the former lockup has attracted more than a million visitors a year, one of the most popular National Park sites,according tothe Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.Visitors this month tour the prison cells on Alcatraz Island.Jed Jacobsohn/APBut Trump sees the site much differently.“It represents something strong, very powerful in terms of law and order. Our country needs law and order; Alcatraz is, I would say, the ultimate,” the president said Monday. “We’ll see if we can bring it back in large form, add a lot.”Widner, the Anglins’ nephew, has visited Alcatraz many times. He says he stays out of political debates but doesn’t like the idea of scrapping the museum to make Alcatraz great again.“I think it’s a bad idea,” Widner said. “You would be losing a lot of history there.”CNN’s FJ Feng and Alex Matthews contributed to this report.",

Things could have been a lot worse, but I’m here smiling in front of you all at this facility right now.”Such was the discussion around Sanders’ slide down the draft, US President Donald Trump even posted on social media in support of the former Colorado star.Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders was selected by the Cleveland Browns with the 144th overall pick during the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft.Perry Knotts/Getty ImagesRelated articleThe Shedeur Sanders slide and who were the winners: what we learned from the 2025 NFL draftSanders said Saturday he was “truly thankful” for the support from the president, as well as “other fans, people in barber shops, just lots of fans.”He added that “other people’s opinion of you is gonna be based off their own.”“Ninety-nine percent of hatred is towards pops and then I’m just his son, so it really just comes from that.

      "content": "WashingtonCNN—Mónica got pregnant last year around the same time President Donald Trump was elected to a second term. And that is when her race against the calendar began.The Venezuelan national, who is in the United States legally but with temporary status, is terrified that Trump’s long-promisedeffort to curb birthright citizenshipwill be allowed to take effect before her baby boy is due in August – an outcome that could effectively leave him stateless.“There’s been a lot of fear,” the South Carolinian told CNN. “Every day it’s a new restriction, and we don’t know what will happen.”Mónica asked to be identified in this story by her first name because she is concerned about possible repercussions for speaking publicly about her situation.When theSupreme Court gathers Thursdayto hear oral argument in a high-profile emergency appeal involving Trump’s birthright citizenship order, the justices will technically be considering a procedural question about whether lower courts overstepped their authority by blocking the president’s efforts nationwide. But the court’s answer to that question will have enormous on-the-ground consequences, even for people – like Mónica – who are in the United States legally.Allowing the administration to temporarily enforce the order Trump signed on his first day of his second term could set up a dynamic in which a baby born in New Jersey would be able to access a passport or obtain a Social Security number, but a child born into the same circumstances across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania could not.The US Supreme Court is seen on April 7 in Washington, DC.Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesanalysisFour questions in the Supreme Court arguments in birthright citizenship casesOr the court could rule in a way that allows Trump to enforce the order against all but a handful of individuals.For nearly 150 years, courts have understood the14th Amendment’s textto guarantee citizenship to anyone “born or naturalized in the United States,” regardless of the immigration status of their parents. In a landmark 1898 decision,US v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court affirmed the idea that people born in the United States – in that case, the son of Chinese immigrants – were entitled to US citizenship, with a few narrow exceptions.But a small group of legal conservatives have for years focused on a second phrase in the amendment’s text, requiring people to be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States before they become entitled to citizenship. People who owe their allegiance to another country, the argument goes, are not covered. Trump often chafed against birthright citizenship during his first term and campaigned heavily on the idea of ending it if he returned to power.Those arguments will not be before the Supreme Court this week, but the absence of a question on the merits raises a thorny practical question for the justices: How much should they take the broader constitutional issues into account if they decide to allow Trump to enforce a policy – even temporarily – that flies in the face of a long-standing recognition that a person born in the United States, regardless of their parents’ immigration status, is entitled to citizenship?“As a practical matter, I think the merits will to some degree have to be in the back of their minds,” said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University and close observer of the Supreme Court. “It’s hard for anyone – probably even including a Supreme Court justice – to totally put those arguments aside in a situation like this.”‘Blatantly unconstitutional’Mónica, who is in her 30s, and her husband fled Venezuela because her family worked for the opposition to the country’s authoritarian government of Nicolás Maduro. She came to the United States in 2019 and benefits from a form of humanitarian relief known as temporary protected status.The Trump administration has moved to end TPS for Venezuelan nationals, and the Supreme Court isconsidering a separate emergency appealon the process it used to do so.Trump’s executive order,signed on January 20, blocks federal agencies from issuing documents recognizing citizenship for people born to noncitizen parents but also people in the country on a temporary basis. Multiple federal courts blocked its implementation nationwide, including one judge in Seattle nominated by President Ronald Reagan who describedTrump’s effort as “blatantly unconstitutional.”A challenge for Mónica is that there would be no realistic way for her to secure Venezuelan citizenship for her son if he was unable to obtain a US passport.Maduro cut diplomatic tieswith the United States in 2019. Even if she could reach an embassy in another country, Mónica said she wouldn’t apply for a citizenship from a government her family is attempting to escape.“We left fleeing persecution,” Mónica said through an interpreter. “It would be a risk to make him a Venezuelan citizen because we’re actively seeking asylum from the Venezuelan government.”In an unusual quirk of the case, Mónica will likely ultimately be able to obtain US citizenship for her son because she belongs to the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a membership organization for people seeking asylum. The Trump administration has said in court papers it wants to enforce the order on a temporary basis against everyone except for certain members of ASAP, which is also representing Mónica, and another group.By the time the underlying case over birthright citizenship is resolved, Mónica’s child will likely be walking.Meny, a native of Honduras who came to the United States with her husband and son in 2021, is in the same position. Her second son is due in July.“I was already pregnant when I started to hear rumors that the president would likely be taking away birthright citizenship,” said Meny, a California resident who also asked to be identified by her first name only. “I remember thinking it was so scary that my son had not yet been born and that his rights would be violated.”Meny, who is seeking asylum in the United States, said she is concerned about the conversation she might need to have with her son someday about his status.“As a mom – as a parent – it would be very difficult for me to explain to him why he doesn’t have those rights,” she said.Separation of powersThe difference between what’s technically at issue in the case and the practical implications of the ruling have allowed groups on both sides to frame the emergency appeal in their own terms. The administration has focused almost exclusively on the separation of powers and what it sees as the courts’ encroachment into the executive branch. Immigration groups, meanwhile, have warned the Supreme Court of “chaos” and say a ruling for Trump could “fundamentally fracture the country.”Trump has asked the Supreme Court not to lift the lower court orders blocking enforcement entirely, but rather to limit those orders to the states and individuals who originally sued. That could mean blocking its enforcement in 22 blue states or, possibly, against a handful of individuals. As a backup argument, the administration has urged the Supreme Court to at least allow it to plan for implementing the order at some point in the future. Anyone outside of those states or group of individuals then could be subject to enforcement.The administration has described that as a “modest” request.“Years of experience have shown that the executive branch cannot properly perform its functions if any judge anywhere can enjoin every presidential action everywhere,” the Department of Justice told the Supreme Court in March.Such a decision, if it offered further guidance or limitations on when district court judges could universally block a policy or law could have ramifications far beyond birthright citizenship.GianCarlo Canaparo, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, noted that presidents of both parties – and both liberal and conservative justices – have raised concerns in recent years about the number of orders from federal judges that enjoin enforcement of a policy against not only the people who sued but everyone else in the nation. Those orders, known asnationwide or universal injunctions, have become common during the second Trump administration.Canaparo said he was unpersuaded by arguments that a uniform approach to citizenship in all states might supply a good reason for a nationwide injunction in this case.“The argument that we need uniform laws is a policy judgment,” he said, “which is just historically not a permissible basis for courts to be granting remedies of different sizes and scope.”But while emergency orders don’t decide the merits of a case, they often have significant practical implications in the short term. In 2021, the Supreme Court declined to block a Texas law that banned most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy – even though the law conflicted with the court’s landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. The court’s decision effectively allowed Texas to enforce that six-week ban. Months later, the court’s conservative majority overturned Roe.The Supreme Court is expected to hear more than an hour of argument on Thursday and hand down a decision sometime before the end of June.Between doctor visits and trips to supply their nurseries, Mónica and Meny will be following the outcome anxiously.“Because we’re immigrants doesn’t mean that we’re enemies of this country,” Meny said. “We come because we have a necessity.”",

It has beenvery difficult,” he said afterward in his on-court interview. “He is such a great player, especially on this surface. I tried to move around the ball.“At times it went very well, at times it could be better, yes, but in any case, it doesn’t matter about the result today. It has been a remarkable day for me, so I’m very happy.”He took the first set with relative ease, producing 11 winners as his typical hard-hitting at times forced Navone off the court. The second set seemed to be unfolding in a similar fashion as Sinner once again broke Navone early on but the Argentine fought back, breaking the world No. 1 as he snatched at a forehand that went into the net.Sinner will now play Jesper de Jong in the tournament’s third round on Monday.",

      "content": "CNN—The latest round of high-stakes nuclear talks between Iran and the US have ended, with Tehran calling them difficult but with both sides agreeing to further negotiations.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei confirmedon Xthat the talks had concluded,﻿saying they were “difficult but useful to better understand each other’s positions and to find reasonable & realistic ways to address the differences.”A senior Trump administration official gave a more positive assessment, telling CNN the discussions “were again both direct and indirect” and lasted over three hours, calling them encouraging.“Agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements,” the official said, adding that the US side was “encouraged by today’s outcome” and looks forward to their next meeting “which will happen in the near future.”No date has been agreed for the next round although Baqaei said it would be announced by mediator Oman.Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the fifth round of talks would take place once both sides have consulted their leaders. He said Sunday’s discussions included “useful and original ideas” that reflected a shared wish to reach an “honorable” agreement.Red lines drawnThe talks on Sunday were aimed at addressing Tehran’s nuclear program and lifting sanctions.That they are happening at all is something of a breakthrough – the talks are the highest-level in years – but signs of firm progress are slim.Both countries have expressed a willingness to resolve their disputes through diplomacy. A central issue remains Iran’s demand to continue enriching uranium for its nuclear program, which is insists is peaceful, something the US calls a “red line.”US President Donald Trump, who is headed to the Middle East next week, has threatened that the US would resort to military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, with Israel’s help, should Tehran fail to reach a deal with its interlocutors.The Iranian delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who said before the talks got underway that the US side “holds contradictory positions which is one of the issues in our negotiations.”“We have been clear about our boundaries,” Araghchi added, according to the Fars news agency.Iranian officials told CNN on Saturday that recent talks with the US were “not genuine” from the American side. The Iranian source also reiterated that allowing uranium enrichment on Iranian soil is Iran’s “definite red line” in the negotiations.US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been heading the American side, warned that if this session of talks were not productive, “then they won’t continue and we’ll have to take a different route.”Speaking to Breitbart, Witkoff outlined the US’ expectations for the talks, including on the country’s uranium enrichment program. “An enrichment program can never exist in the state of Iran ever again. That’s our red line. No enrichment,” he said.Iran has said it will not surrender its capability to enrich uranium. The country has long insisted it does not want a nuclear weapon and that its program is for energy purposes.The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, warned last month that Iran was “not far” from possessing a nuclear bomb.“It’s like a puzzle. They have the pieces, and one day they could eventually put them together,” Grossi told French newspaper Le Monde.This story has been updated.",

      "content": "RomeCNN—Pope Leo XIVstepped out onto the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica to thunderous applause and an electric atmosphere, to deliver his first Sunday blessing and an address calling for peace in Ukraine and Gaza.The last time he stood on the same velvet-draped ledge, the fragrant scent of white smoke was still hanging in the air and looks of shock permeated the crowd. Just days ago, the election of aUS-born popeseemed almost impossible.But those gathered in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday knew exactly what to expect – a pontiff who was born in Chicago, shaped in Peru and well-experienced in Vatican leadership.Newly elected Pope Leo XIV waves from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday.Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersRelated article10 things to know about Robert Prevost, who is now Pope Leo XIV“Let us take up the invitation that Pope Francis left us in his Message for today: the invitation to welcome and accompany young people,” Leo said Sunday from the balcony, speaking in fluent Italian. “And let us ask our heavenly Father to assist us in living in service to one another.”“In today’s dramatic scenario of a third world war being fought piecemeal, as Pope Francis said, I too turn to the world’s leaders with an ever timely appeal: never again war!,” he said.Pope Leo called for an “authentic, just and lasting peace” in Ukraine, as well as a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages. He also called for humanitarian aid to be provided “to the exhausted civilian population” in Gaza.“I welcomed with satisfaction the announcement of the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, and I hope that through the upcoming negotiations we can soon reach a lasting agreement,” he added.He told the crowd he was there to deliver a message of peace and led the faithful in the Regina Caeli (“Queen of Heaven”) prayer for the first time, surprising those gathered by singing the prayer.The prayer is one of four Marian antiphons, or prayers to the Virgin Mary, which is said throughout the Easter season.Tens of thousands of people gathered in St. Peter's Square on Sunday.Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesAbout 100,000 people were gathered in St. Peter’s Square for the prayer, according to Vatican Media.The square was booming with music ahead of Leo’s address, as hundreds of musicians from around the world marched into St. Peter’s Square for a Jubilee of Bands, playing classic songs from their home countries and even pop songs like Village People’s 1978 hit “YMCA.”As he finished his address, loud shouts of “viva il papa,” or “long live the pope,” were heard among the tens of thousands of people. Flags from across the globe, including the United States, Mexico, Brazil and Spain, dotted the crowd.Pope Leo is indicated on Saturday that his papacy will follow closely in thefootsteps of the late Pope Francis,setting out a visionfor a church led be a missionary focus, courageous dialogue with the contemporary world and “loving care for the least and the rejected.”Leo is expected to lean in a more progressive way on social issues like migration and poverty but fall more in line with moderates on moral issues of Catholic doctrine.A rosary hangs on an American flag as people gather in St. Peter's Square.Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty ImagesPope Leo XIV led Mass in the Vatican grottoes on Sunday morning before singing the Regina Caeli from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.Francesco Sforza/Vatican Media via ReutersIn his first meeting with cardinals on Saturday, the new pontiff said that he chose his papal name to continue down the path of Pope Leo XIII, who addressed “the social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution.” Leo XIII, who was pope from 1878 to 1903, had a strong emphasis on workers’ rights and Catholic social doctrine.Leo XIV also used his first weekend as pontiff to visit the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, where he prayed at thetomb of Francis.He also traveled to an Augustinian sanctuary just outside Rome, the Madonna del Buon Consiglio (Mother of Good Counsel), in Genazzano, Italy.Leo is the first pontiff from the Augustinian order, which places an emphasis on service work and building community. He spent more than a decade leading the Augustinians as the prior general, giving him experience of heading an order spread across the world.Even larger crowds are expected to fill St. Peter’s Square during Pope Leo’s installation Mass, which will take place on Sunday, May 18.CNN’s Sharon Braithwaite and Christopher Lamb contributed to this report.",

      "content": "Los AngelesCNN—Kip’s Toyland has sold toys to children in Los Angeles for almost 80 years, through wars, recessions and a pandemic. But nowtariffs of 145% on most Chinese importsthreaten the livelihood of the city’s oldest toy shop, considering thatnearly 80% of toyssold in the United States are made in China.“We’ve been getting letters and other communication from our suppliers that say, ‘Fasten your seat belts, this is on the way,’” said Don Kipper, the store’s owner.In letters that Kipper read to CNN, suppliers announced price increases and urged bulk ordering before tariff pricing kicks in.It’s another sign that President Donald Trump’s tumultuous trade war — and China’s retaliatory tariffs — have left the American toy industry reeling. The US imported about $13.4 billion worth of toys from China last year, according to US Commerce Department data, not least because of the toy manufacturing infrastructure that was created and strengthened there over the last 25 years.For Kipper, whose inventory mostly comes from China, tariffs mean prices will inevitably increase — and he’s not sure what he’ll do. He said a small business like his can’t afford to stock up, nor is it able to store a large amount of inventory.Other suppliers wrote to Kipper about halting their production lines, which would have supplied toys for the holiday shopping season.“Please know this decision was not made lightly,” Kipper read from one letter.“So nobody’s happy about it.”A post-war dreamKip’s Toyland was started by Irvin “Kip” Kipper, Don Kipper’s father and a pilot during World War II. Kipper said that when his father’s plane was shot down in Bologna, Italy, he was captured and taken to Germany as a Nazi prisoner of war.Kipper said his father “decided if he ever got out, he was going to do something happy with the rest of his life.”Don Kippercourtesy The Original Farmers MarketNearly a year later, in August 1945, the elder Kipper was liberated by George Patton’s troops. In October of that year, he purchased a small store selling flags and dolls, the beginning of Kip’s Toyland in Los Angeles.“When he opened the store, there were very few toy stores,” Don Kipper said. “Toys used to be sold in hardware stores and department stores. There were no standalone toy stores.”That same year, the first Slinkys were sold in the United States. They were made in Pennsylvania and continue to be produced there. The Slinky is one of the few US-made products still sold at Kip’s Toyland.Most of the items on the store’s shelves are nowmanufactured in China. Kipper said many board games once made in the US are now made in China, and some American toy manufacturers like Marx and Ideal have shut down or been acquired by other brands.Lower labor costs in China led to a vast infrastructure of toy manufacturing there over the last several decades, Chris Byrne, independent toy analyst, told CNN. Bringing that infrastructure to the United States is not impossible but would take a minimum of five years, he said. Even then, prices would rise,  due to American labor and regulatory costs.Kip's Toyland sells classic toys, where kids can touch and feel everything from puzzles to Slinkys.courtesy The Original Farmers MarketWhile the manufacturing location has changed, the type of toys sold at Kip’s Toyland has not changed much. The store doesn’t sell anything that needs to be plugged in. It is a haven of classic toys - a place where children can roam the small aisles, seeing and touching the variety of puzzles, trucks and dolls, an experience largely lost in the internet age.Changing buying habitsAeri Schwartz, a mother who comes to the store with her toddler once every few months, looked at a toy fire truck that cost $20. But if it suddenly became $30 under the weight of tariffs, Schwartz said they’d have to scale back on what they buy.“Coming to a store like this in person is really special,” Schwartz said. “There aren’t a lot of places like this in Los Angeles. It’s a real treasure – and so not being able to come here and buy something would be pretty unfortunate.”Chelsea Kwoka, another parent who has purchased toys from Kip’s, said she would not be able to buy as much if toys suddenly cost significantly more.Higher prices from suppliers facing tariffs could mean higher prices on the shelves for parents and children.CNN“I would see the opportunity of pivoting toward purchasing things like a membership to our local zoo or the aquarium,” Kwoka said. She said she also likes to buy used toys on Facebook Marketplace or pass down toys to other families in parent groups.“I think it’s a rough time for everybody in a lot of ways, and if I’m being real, buying less stuff is not a problem I want to solve,” she said.Kipper is aware his store could struggle. But he still expects there will be a parent here and there who runs in, looking for a last-minute birthday gift. Other than hoping customers continue to buy, his only strategy is to “buy smart,” choosing cost-effective toys people can still afford.But if the classic toys at Kip’s Toyland suddenly becomemore expensive to acquire, he will have to pay more.“It’s a hostage situation. If we have to, we have to,” he said.",

      "content": "CNN—Several of the key voter groups that provided PresidentDonald Trump’s most important electoral gains in November are recoiling from him as his term moves past the100-day mark. But it remains unclear how much Democrats can benefit from these growing doubts.In 2024, Trump improved his performance among some big voting blocs that have historically favored Democrats, including Latinos, younger men, non-White voters without a college degree, and, to some extent, Black men. Trump’s advances generated exuberant predictions from an array of right-leaning analysts that he had achieved a lastingrealignmentand cementedthe GOP’s holdon voters of all races without a college degree.But the flurry ofpolls100 days into Trump’s second term suggests that cement has not hardened as much as some allies anticipated. Across multiple surveys, Trump’s overall job approval rating has fallen below his 2024 vote share with these key groups, and they are consistently giving him even lower marks for his handling of the economy, particularly inflation.“The collapse that he’s experiencing — I think that’s the right word to phrase it — is broad-based and it’s deep,” said Mike Madrid, an expert onLatino votersand a longtime Republican consultant who has become a leading Trump critic in the party.Few strategists in either party believe the cooling toward Trump means Democrats have erased their long-term problems with these voter groups, which have generally drifted toward the GOP since the end of Barack Obama’s presidency. But the rapid erosion of Trump’s standing with them does suggest that their movement toward him in 2024 was driven less by a durable rightward shift on cultural issues than by immediate discontent with their economic situation. And that means that rather than solidifying as part of the GOP coalition, many of these voters likely will remain up for grabs if Trump can’t improve their finances any more than President Joe Biden did.“What we don’t see is an across-the-board realignment all up and down behind Trump’s agenda,” said Robert P. Jones, president and founder of the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, or PRRI,which recently completed a large-scale surveyof Americans’ attitudes on cultural issues.Shadows of a realignment in 2024Whether measured by Election Day surveys or precinct-level results, Trump’s improvement among voter groups that had not traditionally supported the GOP was arguably the biggest factor in his return to the White House.Boththe exit pollsconducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN andthe AP VoteCast survey conducted by NORCat the University of Chicago found that Trump’s vote among White people was virtually identical from 2020 to 2024 and improved just modestly among voters older than 30.But all data sources agreed that Trump made significant gains among groups that had been pillars of what was once called the “Obama coalition” and what I termed in 2008 “the coalition of the ascendant.”The exit polls and VoteCast studies, for instance, both found that Trump in 2024 won around 45% of voters younger than 30, up from 36% in 2020. Both showed he gained much more among young men than among young women.Likewise, both sources showed Trump crossing 40% support among Latinos, a modern high for the GOP, up from about one-third in 2020. The VoteCast study also found Trump doubling his vote among Black men to about 1 in 4. (The exit poll did not find meaningful improvement for him with them.)Supporters of President Donald Trump wait for him to speak at a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona, on October 19, 2020.Alex Brandon/APThe most attention after the election focused on Trump’s improvement among minority voters without a four-year college degree. The exit polls and AP VoteCast agreed that Trump carried almost exactly one-third of them, a big improvement over the roughly one-fourth of their votes he carried in 2020.Since Trump’s first term, a growing number of center-right analysts in both parties have argued that Democrats were alienating working-class non-White voters by emphasizing culturally liberal and “woke” positions on issues such as transgender rights or the use of “Latinx” to describe Latinos. Many of these voices took Trump’s 2024 gains as proof that non-White voters without a college degree were now realigning away from Democrats toward the GOP, primarily around cultural issues, just as non-college-educated White voters did during the 1960s and 1970s.“The Democrats really are no longer the party of the common man and woman,” Ruy Teixeira, a longtime Democratic analyst who has become a leading critic of the party,wrote immediately after the election. “This election has made this problem manifest in the starkest possible terms, as the Democratic coalition shattered into pieces.”Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini, author of “Party of the People,” a book that perceptively analyzes the GOP’s growing strength among working-class minorities, summarized the results even more succinctly: “No word for it but … realignment,” hewrote on social media few weeks after the vote.Signs point to a focus on economic issues — not cultural onesJust over 100 days into Trump’s second term, the picture, at the least, looks much more fluid.The swarm of national polls marking Trump’s 100 days shows his job approval rating among young people, Latinos and Black Americans falling below — often well below — his 2024 vote shares. His ratings on the economy with those groups are even weaker. And while Trump still receives decent grades from Hispanic and young people for his handling of the border, ratings of his overall approach to immigration have consistently fallen into negative territory with them as well.Trump’s position has equally eroded among the group whose shift toward him last year attracted the most attention: the large number of minority Americans without a four-year college degree. His approval rating among those blue-collar racial minorities stands at just 29%in the latest CNN/SRSS poll, according to results provided by the CNN polling unit. (The latestNew York Times/Siena,Pew Research CenterandWashington Post/ABC/Ipsossurveys produced nearly identical results among that group.)Just 27% of non-college-educated people of color approved of Trump’s economic performance in the CNN survey, and two-thirds of them thought he was “going too far” in his deportation agenda. Nearly 3 in 4 of them in the Washington Post survey said Trump does not respect the rule of law, and just 1 in 6 in the New York Times/Siena poll agreed with his assertion that he should be allowedto send US citizens to a prison in El Salvador.President Donald Trump walks to the South Lawn prior to departing the White House on February 22 in Washington, DC.Andrew Thomas/AFP/Middle East Images/Getty ImagesRelated articleHow the economy may frustrate Trump’s drive to expand presidential powerComing so soon in 2025, this broad dissatisfaction is casting a retrospective shadow over what happened in 2024. Madrid says the recoil from Trump, particularly among Latinos, makes clear that the movement toward him in 2024 was based mostly on economic factors rather than affinity for his cultural and racial views. “This is just another brick in the wall of the argument that this (Latino voter) is an economic voter,” Madrid said.Jones similarly thinks the quick distancing from Trump strengthens the argument that his 2024 gains among minority and younger voters were driven more by the economy than by a cultural realignment. In PRRI’s recent national survey, Hispanic, Black and Gen Z adults were all much less likely than Trump’s core constituency of White voters without a four-year college degree to agree with foundational MAGA beliefs, such as that Whites and Christians are the real victims of discrimination or that “immigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background.”“There’s a real danger that Trump is overreaching on the cultural issues,” Jones said.Republican former Rep. Carlos Curbelo likewise believes Trump may be pushing his Latino supporters too far with the sweep of hisdeportation agenda, especially while they remain stressed about the economy. “Democrats were wrong to believe that Hispanic voters would never prioritize border security and the deportation of the undocumented,” Curbelo wrote in an email. “(But) the current Administration is wrong if they think Hispanic voters will perform like MAGA base voters on immigration enforcement matters.”Rep. Carlos Curbelo speaks during a press conference on June 27, 2018.Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call/Getty ImagesRay Serrano, national director of research and policy at LULAC, a Hispanic advocacy organization, sees Trump’s decline in terms that are even more absolute. “If there was a flirtation with possibly moving to the Trump side, to the Republican side, it’s moving away now,” Serrano said during a recent conference call that Latino advocacy groups held to release a national survey from a bipartisan polling team about Trump’s first 100 days. The disappointed response to Trump’s return, he argued, could signal “the rise and immediate fall of the Trump Latino Democrat.”Trump’s gains aren’t necessarily goneIt may be as premature, though, to dismiss Trump’s inroads among these traditionally Democratic groups as it was to declare them proof of a durable realignment. All the 100-days surveys provide evidence that many of these voters, though disappointed in Trump’s first days, have not shut the door on him.Republican pollster Daron Shaw, for instance, said the survey conducted for Latino advocacy groups by a bipartisan polling team found that both Trump’s job approval and support for some of his most controversial initiatives, such as deporting people without hearings or ending diversity initiatives, remained much stronger among men younger than 40 than any other group of Latinos.And, as Jones pointed out, some of Trump’s conservative cultural views continue to resonate with minority voters, especially men. Big majorities of Latino men and women and Black men, for instance, agreed in the PRRI poll that transgender people should be required to use the bathroom of their gender at birth; a substantial minority of each group also agreed with the conservative perspective that society is better off when men and women accept traditional gender roles.Even on the economy, the polls show some room for Trump, with many of his new voters saying it is too soon to render a verdict on his impact. The latest CNN poll was typical: Half of minority adults without college degrees said Trump has done nothing to address the nation’s problems, compared with only about 1 in 5 who said his agenda was already helping. But slightly more than another 1 in 4 of them said his agenda could generate benefits in time. That suggests he could recover among blue-collar non-White voters if they see progress on their biggest concerns, principally inflation.John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard Kennedy SchoolInstitute of Politics’ youth poll, agreed that Trump’s attraction for younger voters has been frayed, not severed. “A lot of the newer Trump voters could say they disapprove of him, and they are unsure of his policies, but they are telling me they are giving him some time,” said Della Volpe, who also advised a super PAC in 2024 that tried to rally young voters for Vice President Kamala Harris.Della Volpe says younger voters’ uncertainty about Trump hasn’t erased their doubts about Democrats. Though the Harvard survey has recorded sharp declines in support for Trump’s economic management just since January, Della Volpe said, “it doesn’t mean Democrats at this stage are a viable alternative.”Madrid likewise thinks it would be a mistake for Democrats to assume the discontent with Trump has solved their own problems with Latinos and other blue-collar minority voters. He correctly notes that Democrats’ performance among Latinos rebounded in the 2018 midterm elections relative to 2016, only to resume their decline in the 2020 presidential election and continue downward in 2024.The party could likewise run better among Latinos in 2026 than in 2024, Madrid says, solely because the less frequent, often younger, Latino voters most drawn to Trump tend not to turn out as much in midterm elections. But unless Democrats develop a more convincing economic message, he says, those less-reliable voters could easily prefer the GOP again when they return in larger numbers in 2028. “The lesson that Democrats failed to learn in 2018 could come back and haunt them in this election cycle: Winning just by being against something does not cement or build the coalition,” Madrid said.Trump so far has clearly failed to consolidate, much less extend, the beachhead he established last year with younger and non-White voters. His sweeping tariffs, by raising their daily costs, seem likely to weaken his position with them.But in the battle for these voters’ long-term allegiance, Democrats would be dangerously complacent to conclude the tide has already turned. Young people and blue-collar minorities, especially the men in each group, now look less like reliable voters for either party than a volatile swing constituency that could tip future presidential contests based on which side they believe can best deliver for their bottom line.",

      "content": "CNN—Democrats have one big hope as they scramble to find a top-tier recruit against GOP Sen. Susan Collins in Maine: Maybe she won’t run at all.Collins, the lone New England Senate Republican, who is at the peak of her influence over 28 years in the chamber, has fended off one Democratic foe after another in hard-fought races to hang on to her seat. And again, her seat is pivotal in the Democrats’ uphill climb back to the majority.But Collins, 72, has yet to make a formal announcement that she’ll run in what will almost certainly be a bruising battle for a sixth term. And high-profile potential Democratic candidates, like Gov. Janet Mills and Rep. Jared Golden, are weighing their next moves as they await the veteran senator’s final decision.In an interview with CNN, Collins signaled she does plan to run but wasn’t ready to say so officially.“It’s certainly my inclination to run and I’m preparing to do so,” Collins told CNN late last week. “I very much enjoy serving the people of Maine. I’ve obviously not made a formal announcement because it’s too early for that.”National Republicans believe that Collins — a moderate who chairs the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and sits in the bluest GOP-held seat in the nation — will indeed be on the ballot next November. But if Collins decides against another run, it would transform the race and give Democrats their best chance at flipping a seat in the midterms.Yet if Collins does run, Democrats insist they can still flip the seat, buoyed by public and private polling that shows the incumbent facing new weaknesses because of the unpopularity ofPresident Donald Trumpand the expectation that it will be a difficult midterm for Republicans — as is historically the case for a president’s party.But they have one big problem. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his team still have not yet landed a top-tier Democratic challenger against the famously formidable Collins.“I’m very hopeful we will have the strongest candidate possible for Maine,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who leads the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, told CNN. “I’m bullish on Maine.”Behind the scenes, Democratic leaders have begun their outreach to key candidates.Schumer has personally spoken about the race with Mills, the 77-year-old governor who recentlyclashed with Trumpover issues including transgender athletes this year, according to two sources with knowledge of the conversations. Mills, those sources said, was noncommittal on a run and has publicly downplayed the idea that she may try to take on Collins.Another Democrat the party sees as a formidable challenger to Collins: Golden, a 42-year-old centrist who’s urged his party to beless elitistand more open to Trump.But there’s a catch. Many Democrats do not believe Golden would run against Collins out of principle, since she is his former boss — a highly unusual position in hyperpartisan Washington. Golden once worked as a staffer in Collins’ DC office and retains close ties to the senator. (In Collins’ last race, Golden remained neutral to preserve hispersonal relationshipwith the senator.)Asked about whether he would run against Collins, Golden quipped: “Is she running?”Golden’s future has been closely watched in Washington for another key reason. His House seat is one of Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s top targets in an extremely narrow battlefield in 2026. And in Washington, no one knows exactly which office he’ll be seeking in 2026 — House, Senate or governor, according to half a dozen sources involved in congressional campaigns.“According to the press, I’m running for all of them,” Golden said in an interview, when asked about his path in 2026. He would not reveal his preference and said the decision is “not top of mind” because he is focused on his job in the House. “I’m on my own timeline,” he told CNN.Democrats are tracking one other candidate already in the race: Jordan Wood, who previously served as chief of staff to former Rep. Katie Porter. But whether Wood — a novice candidate who calls himself a “pro-democracy advocate” — could run toe-to-toe with Collins remains unclear.Asked about possible candidates, Gillibrand declined to elaborate, telling CNN: “I’m not going to tell you. We talk to lots of people.”But Collins’ complicated relationship with Trump adds another twist to the race — especially if the president continues to attack her, something that could help her appeal to independents but turn off MAGA-aligned voters in Maine.Collins voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial after the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack and has long refused to say whom she voted for in the 2020 election — while writing in Nikki Haley in the 2024 election and publicly announcing she wouldn’t support Trump in 2016. This year, she voted against some of hisnominees, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and FBI Director Kash Patel.But she has cast key votes to help advance her party’s agenda over the years and some of Trump’s most controversial picks, whether it was to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. And now in the 53-47 GOP-led Senate, Collins remains one of the few swing votes — including over Trump’s“big, beautiful bill”that is expected to include deep cuts to an array of federal programs.Asked about how much harder Trump would make her race, Collins pointed to her own brand in the state.“I always run on my own record, and that’s what I will do this time,” Collins told CNN.Ripple effect in the House as Golden weighs next stepsLike Collins, whatever Golden decides could determine the fate of his ultra-competitive House seat.With Golden’s decision unclear, a high-profile Republican candidate — former Maine Gov. Paul LePage — jumped into the race for the sprawling northern Maine district last week.The 76-year-old former governor is a lightning rod in Maine politics. And he’s now seeking a comeback after his loss to Mills for governor in 2022.Despite some of LePage’s contentious past statements on Trump, national Republicans believe his high name ID and fundraising ability will help them lock down a seat that’s eluded them for the past four cycles.“We’ll pick up Maine-02 whether Jared Golden runs or not,” Rep. Richard Hudson, the House GOP campaign chief, said. “We came close last time. The district went for Trump. It’s our district.”Asked if he’d feel better if Golden didn’t run, Hudson said: “Sure. Open seat is always easier.”House Democrats are eager to keep Golden in their chamber in a midterm cycle in which every single seat matters to determine which party holds the gavel come January 2027.Rep. Brad Schneider, a senior Illinois Democrat involved in House races, said the party would still attempt to hold Golden’s seat if he decided not to run.“No one’s irreplaceable. People retire, people move on,” Schneider told CNN. But he offered this advice to his fellow Democrat: “If he asks my opinion, I want to keep working with Jared.”CNN’s Ted Barrett, Casey Riddle and Alison Main contributed to this report.",

      "published_at": "2025-05-11 04:00",
      "content": "CNN—They are considered one of the world’s most dangerous, and indiscriminate, weapons. Yet five European countries have turned their backs on an international treaty on the use oflandmines, citing the growing threat from Moscow.Finland, Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania – which all border Russia – have made moves to pull out of theOttawa Treaty, the agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines, which are designed to kill or maim if stepped on.The developments have alarmed campaigners, who see the reintroduction of the weapons – which have killed or disfigured tens of thousands of civilians around the world and can contaminate an area for decades after a conflict ends – as a concerning regression.The treaty, which also bans the weapons’ production and stockpiling, was signed in 1997, and was one of a series of agreements negotiated after the Cold War to encourage global disarmament. Since then, it has been credited with significantly reducing the harm from landmines.Responding to Finland’s decision to leave the agreement, human rights NGO Amnesty International warned that the Nordic nation was endangering civilian lives, describing it as a “disturbing step backwards.”The decision “goes against decades of progress on eliminating the production, transfer and use of inherently indiscriminate weapons,” the NGO warned.At the start of this year, the pact had 165 member states. But major powers, including Russia, China, India, Pakistan and the United States, never signed up to it.In a joint statement in March, Poland and the three Baltic states announced their withdrawal, arguing for a rethink on which weapons are – and which ones are not – acceptable in the face of Russia’s aggression.The countries said they needed to provide their armed forces with greater “flexibility and freedom of choice,” to help them bolster the defense of NATO’s eastern flank.The following month, in April, Latvia became the first country to formally withdraw from the treaty after its parliament strongly backed the proposal, meaning that after a grace period of six months, Riga would be able to start amassing landmines again.Also that month, Finland unveiled plans to join Latvia. Explaining the decision, Finland’s Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told journalists that Russia poses a long-term danger to the whole of Europe. “Withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention will give us the possibility to prepare for the changes in the security environment in a more versatile way,” he said.A Finnish soldier pictured last November. In April, Finland announced its plans to withdraw from the Ottawa Treaty.Leon Neal/Getty ImagesThe announcements come as U.S. President Donald Trump has doubled down on efforts to wrap up the war in Ukraine, which has stoked fears in neighboring states that Moscow could re-arm and target them instead.Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow of the Russia and Eurasia program at the thinktank Chatham House and author of the book “Who will Defend Europe?,” believes that if and when Russia’s grinding conflict in Ukraine does come to an end by whatever means, Moscow will be readying itself for its next target.“Nobody is in any doubt that Russia is looking for further means of achieving its objective in Europe,” Giles told CNN.For Giles, the military benefits of using landmines are clear. The underground explosives, he said, can slow an invasion, either by redirecting oncoming troops to areas that are easier to defend, or by holding them up as they attempt to breach the mined areas.They can be particularly beneficial for countries looking to defend themselves against an army with greater manpower. “They are a highly effective tool for augmenting the defensive forces of a country that’s going to be outnumbered,” he said.He believes the five countries leaving the treaty have looked at the effectiveness of the weapons, including their use in Russia’s war on Ukraine, in deterring invading forces.However, he stressed that the Western countries wouldn’t use landmines in the same way as Moscow’s forces, saying there were “very different design philosophies” in the manufacturing of mines and cluster munitions between countries that aren’t concerned with civilian casualties or may willingly try to cause them, and those that are trying to avoid them.In Ukraine, extensive Russian minefields laid along Ukraine’s southern front lines significantly slowed asummer counteroffensivelaunched by Ukraine in 2023.Ukraine is deemed by the United Nations to be the most heavily mined country in the world. In its most recent projections, Ukraine’s government estimates that Moscow’s forces have littered 174,000 square kilometers (65,637 square miles) of Ukraine’s territory with landmines and explosive remnants.Ukrainian soldiers demine a field in Mykolaiv Oblast, Ukraine, in November 2022.Narciso Contreras/Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesThis means Ukrainian civilians, particularly those who have returned to areas previously on the front lines of the fighting, are faced with an ever-present risk of death.“The large-scale contamination of land by explosive ordnance has created an ‘invisible threat’ in people’s minds,” Humanity & Inclusion, an international charity helping those affected by poverty, conflict, and disaster,warnedin a February report on the use of landmines in Ukraine. “As a result, people’s movements are extremely reduced or restricted, they can no longer cultivate their land and their social, economic, or professional activities are hindered.”According tofindingsfrom Human Rights Watch published in 2023, Ukraine has also used antipersonnel landmines during the conflict and has received them from the US, despite Kyiv being a signatory of the 1997 ban.In comparison, Finland, Poland and the Baltic nations say they would remain committed to their humanitarian principles when using the explosives, despite withdrawing from the ban.When announcing its plans to leave the Ottawa Treaty, Helsinki stressed it would use the weapons in a humane manner, with the country’s president Alexander Stubbwritingon X, “Finland is committed to its international obligations on the responsible use of mines.”While the responsible use of landmines is a complex issue, measures to reduce civilian harm can include making precise records of minefields and their locations, educating communities to their dangers and the clearance or neutralization of the weapons once the conflict is over.‘Disturbing step backwards’Despite such pledges of responsibility, the move away from the Ottawa Treaty has left campaigners horrified.Landmines have killed or maimed tens of thousands of civilians across the world and continue to cause harm. In its 2024 report, the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor found that at least 5,757 people were killed and wounded by mines and explosive remnants of war across the globe in 2023, with civilians making up 84% of that number.Alma Taslidžan, from Bosnia, was displaced from her homeland during the war of the early 90s,  only to return with her family to a country laced with landmines – a contamination issue she says plagues the country to this day.Now working for disability charity Humanity & Inclusion, she described the five countries’ decision to pull out of the treaty as “absolute nonsense” and “the most horrible thing that could happen in the life of a treaty.”Canada's former foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy signs the treaty to ban the use of anti-personnel landmines.Dave Chan/AFP via Getty ImagesShe told CNN that the arguments for banning landmines have not changed since the Ottawa Treaty was formed in the 1990s. “Once it’s in the ground, it’s a danger. It cannot distinguish between the foot of a civilian and the foot of a child and the foot of a soldier.”She continued, “We are surprised that such advanced militaries like the Finnish, like the Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, would consider putting this hugely indiscriminate weapon in their military strategy, and what is worse, putting it in their land.”Yet, for some, the new, precarious security reality that Europe is facing means that previous red lines are now up for discussion.This is the case for Giles, who sees the latest developments as a recognition from these countries that treaties on landmines were “an act of idealism which has proven to be over-optimistic by developments in the world since then.”",

      "content": "CNN—Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he is prepared to meet Vladimir Putin this week, shortly after US President Donald Trump urged him to “immediately” accept the Russian leader’s offer to hold peace talks in Turkey.After meeting in Kyiv on Saturday, Ukraine’s major European allies gave Russia an ultimatum: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday or face “massive” new sanctions. Trump supported the initiative, Germany’s new chancellor Friedrich Merz said.In a late-night address, Putin did not acknowledge the ultimatum. Ignoring the ceasefire offer, he instead proposed holding “direct talks” with Ukraine in Turkey on Thursday – something not seen since the early weeks of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022.Ukraine’s allies spent Sunday stressing that there could be no further talks before Putin agrees to an unconditional ceasefire. But Trump undermined the efforts to put pressure on Putin, saying that Ukraine should “immediately” agree to meet with Russian officials on Thursday.“HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Within an hour, Zelensky said he was prepared to meet with Putin this week, in what would be the leaders’ first meeting since Russia launched its war.“I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses,” Zelensky said Sunday on X.Although Zelensky said a “full and lasting ceasefire” from Monday would provide “the necessary basis for diplomacy,” he did not specify that this would be a precondition for attending the talks.Whereas Putin on Saturday faced a joint call from Europe and the US to accept a ceasefire by Monday’s deadline, his counteroffer of “direct” talks had by Sunday relieved much of the pressure on Moscow and shifted the focus to the potential talks this week. European leaders have not yet said whether they will press ahead with the threatened additional sanctions on Russia if a ceasefire is not in place by Monday.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, at right, seated with the leaders of Britain, France, Poland and Germany for a meeting at the Mariinskyi Palace, the official residence of the president of Ukraine, in Kyiv on Saturday.Ludovic Marin/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesBefore Trump’s comment, Zelensky had responded with trepidation to Putin’s offer, calling it a “positive sign,” but stressing that Kyiv first expects Moscow to agree to the new ceasefire proposal. Ukraine’s European allies more forcefully dismissed Putin’s offer, saying there could be no new talks before a ceasefire.Merz, Germany’s new chancellor, said talks “cannot begin until weapons fall silent.” Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the world was still waiting on Russia’s “univocal decision on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.” French President Emmanuel Macron said Putin’s counter-offer was “not enough.”Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s special envoy to Ukraine, whose influence has dwindled since January, echoed the Europeans’ claims, saying a ceasefire must come before talks, “not the other way round.”But Trump abandoned his earlier demand that Russia agree to a 30-day ceasefire, instead calling on Ukraine to attend the peace talks without preconditions.For months, Ukraine and its allies tried to convince the Trump administration that Putin acts in bad faith, and have said Russia’s agreeing to a ceasefire could function as a test of whether it is serious about achieving the peace the US president has long demanded.But Putin’s offer for direct talks – made in a rare televised address at 1 a.m. local time Sunday – was a gamble to distract from the fact that Russia is likely to snub Monday’s ceasefire deadline, analysts said.Putin’s offer put Zelensky under “huge pressure” to agree to hold talks in Turkey, Sergey Radchenko, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told CNN.“Why? Because otherwise, he’ll have to deal with Trump, who’s going to say, ‘Why are you undermining my peace initiative here? Why can’t you just talk?’”Turkey ‘ready’ to host talksAlready setting the stage for talks, Putin spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday. The Kremlin said Erdogan “fully supported” Putin’s proposal for peace talks and had offered Istanbul as a venue.On Monday, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov held a phone call with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan to discuss the start of direct negotiations, according to statements from both sides.Although Ankara confirmed Turkey is ready to host the negotiations, a statement from the country’s presidency suggested that it agreed with Ukraine’s allies that a ceasefire must come before talks.From left: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, France's President Emmanuel Macron, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz pay their respects to the victims of war at the Memorial for the Fallen at the Independence Square (Maidan) in Kyiv on May 10, 2025, ahead of a gathering of European leaders in the Ukranian capital.Ludovic Marin/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleUkraine ceasefire call aimed at forcing Putin to reveal his war goals to Trump“Noting that a window of opportunity to achieve peace has opened, President Erdoğan said that a comprehensive ceasefire would create the necessary environment for peace talks,” the statement read. It did not say whether Turkey would decline to host the talks if Russia refused the ceasefire offer.The White House said Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Turkey from Wednesday to Friday, to attend an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers and discuss “ending the Russia-Ukraine war,” meaning he will be in the country on the day of Putin’s proposed peace talks.Trump’s dropping of his demand for Russia to agree to a ceasefire marks a dramatic change in approach. Last week, Trump had called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, without providing a deadline. “If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,” he warned. The European leaders in Kyiv added weight to the threat by naming Monday as a deadline.Radchenko said that Putin’s late-night offer of peace talks was an attempt to shift the pressure on Russia back onto Ukraine.“He knows that Trump wants direct talks,” Radchenko said. “Now, by saying, ‘Look, we’re offering talks and the Ukrainians are the ones who are not agreeing,’ he is putting the ball back in Kyiv’s court.”As well as distracting from his snubbing the ceasefire proposal, the offer allowed Putin to pose “as the peacemaker, kindly inviting Ukraine to the table,” Radchenko said. “He’s seen as taking the initiative.”In his address, Putin said Russia does not rule out that “during these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,” but stressed that the talks will aim to eliminate the “root causes” of the conflict.Around the same time as Putin’s late-night speech, a three-day pause in fighting ordered by Russia’s leader came to an end, with Ukraine reporting more than 100 drone attacks overnight. Both sides accused each other of continuing attacks during the truce, ordered by Putin to mark Russia’s World War II Victory Day.CNN’s Andrew Carey, Nick Paton Walsh, Alex Stambaugh, Lucas Lilieholm and Ivana Kottasova contributed to this report.",

Maria Fares told The Associated Press, adding that they had no power on the boat.“They had no starter, lights and everything that a battery generates,” she said. To survive, they had to “take rusted water out of the engine (and) when a fish passed by, they caught it and parboiled it to eat.” Fares added that they also drank rain and sea water to survive.This government handout photo shows five shipwrecked fishermen wearing lifejackets, who were rescued by an Ecuadorian tuna fishing boat after being adrift for more than 50 days, at the San Cristobal Naval Base, Galapagos Islands, on May 10.Ecuadorean Navy/APThe men are in stable condition and the navy said it is coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries.Earlier this year, another Peruvian fisherman, 61-year-old Máximo Napa,spent 95 daysat sea alone. He was also rescued by an Ecuadorian vessel and returned to Lima in mid-March to be reunited with his family.",

      "content": "CNN—An Iranian official told CNN that recent indirect talks with the United States aimed at addressing Tehran’s nuclear program and lifting sanctions were “not genuine” from the American side and were likely designed from the outset as a “trap to draw the situation toward tension.”According to the official, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity,Iranevaluates the talks’ interruptions and weekly gaps, which were against Tehran’s preference, as a political and media game by the American side and is now preparing for scenarios in which the talks fail.It comes after US special envoySteve Witkoffwarned on Friday that if the next set of talks in Oman on Sunday were not productive, “then they won’t continue and we’ll have to take a different route.”A US official told CNN Saturday that “President (Donald) Trump is completely sincere in his desire to reach a deal with Iran and is completely committed to getting one.”“The United States will ensure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon, but also wishes for lasting peace in the Middle East, a new relationship with Iran, and for the Iranian people to reach their nations full potential,” said the US official.Sunday’s talks are expected to be high-level only, suggesting that the two sides will discuss a broader framework for moving forward. CNN understands that the technical team, which negotiates on more granular aspects of a deal like sanctions relief, is not expected to attend.Earlier Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi – who is expected to meet Witkoff on Sunday – said Tehran had received “contradictory messages” from the US as “different individuals express different views.”The Iranian source said the American side “is basically not ready for meaningful technical and political talks,” adding that the United States gives “short and general answers” to questions, ignores “main proposals,” and “constantly changes its position” throughout the negotiations.Steve Witkoff attends an interview after in a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, at Diriyah Palace, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on February 18, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein/Pool/ReutersRelated articleUS warns that if Sunday Iran talks aren’t productive, ‘they won’t continue’According to the source, this situation has led Iran to conclude that the negotiations “likely will not yield the desired outcome in sanctions relief and economic benefit.”As a result, Tehran is “preparing for the next stage, with political, economic, and other sectors having prepared the necessary scenarios over the past month.”The comments come after Witkoff, in an interview with Breitbart posted Friday, described the US’ expectations for the talks in some of the greatest detail to date.“An enrichment program can never exist in the state of Iran ever again. That’s our red line. No enrichment. That means dismantlement, it means no weaponization, and it means that Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan – those are their three enrichment facilities – have to be dismantled,” Witkoff said.Iran has said it is nonnegotiable that it be allowed to enrich uranium.The Iranian source reiterated to CNN on Saturday that uranium enrichment on Iranian soil is Iran’s “definite red line” in the negotiations, a fact he said the United States “is well aware of.”Iran has long insisted it does not want a nuclear weapon and that its program is for energy purposes.In his interview with Breitbart, the special envoy said the talks are focused exclusively on the nuclear issue, a change from the attempts of the first Trump administration to deal widely with Iran’s aggressive actions in the region.CNN’s Jennifer Hansler and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

      "content": "CNN—The battle over immigration came to a dramatic head Friday afternoon when Democratic lawmakers faced off with Homeland Security Department officers as they tried to visit a Newark, New Jersey, Immigration Customs and Enforcement facility, despite Congress’ oversight authority of federal facilities.Three members of Congress from New Jersey, along with protesters, faced off with Department of Homeland Security officers on Friday after visiting a local ICE detention facility. The incident started as officers attempted to arrest the mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, after he tried to join the lawmakers inside the facility.As tensions grew, so did the physicality of the situation, with officers and lawmakers pushing and shouting at one another before Baraka, a Democrat, was ultimately detained for several hours. He was released Friday evening.Under the annualappropriations act, which allocates funds for federal agencies, lawmakers are permitted to enter “any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens.”The law is also clear that members of Congress are not required “to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility” in their oversight capacity. A spokesperson for Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, one of the lawmakers who was at the facility Friday, said the group had been allowed to enter and inspect the center sometime between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.After the incident, a DHS official suggested charges could be brought against the members of Congress and accused them of breaking into the facility, despite their legal authority to conduct oversight of the department.DHS in a statement accused the lawmakers of being “holed up in a guard shack” after having “stormed the gate” to break “into the detention facility.”“Members of Congress storming into a detention facility goes beyond a bizarre political stunt and puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and detainees at risk,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement. “Members of Congress are not above the law and cannot illegally break into detention facilities.”Watson Coleman, who was at the facility Friday, forcefully pushed back on the allegation that the members had broken into the facility, saying in a statement that afternoon “we did not ‘storm’ the detention center.”“The author of that press release was so unfamiliar with the facts on the ground that they didn’t even correctly count the number of Representatives present,” the congresswoman said.Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is led away in handcuffs after he took part in a protest outside an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, on Friday.News 12 New JerseyDuring an appearance on CNN’s “First of All” Saturday morning, McLaughlin said ICE has footage that could lead to arrests of lawmakers. “There will likely be more arrests coming. We actually have body camera footage of some of these members of Congress assaulting our ICE enforcement officers, including body slamming a female ICE officer. So we will be showing that to viewers very shortly,” she said.When pressed by CNN’s Victor Blackwell on whether she was suggesting the members of Congress would be arrested, McLaughlin said, “this is an ongoing investigation and that is definitely on the table.”The videos were later released by the department and show the arrest of Baraka, along with more angles of the physical altercations between federal agents, protesters and members of Congress.One video appears to show Rep. LaMonica McIver using her body to push past federal agents to follow Baraka after he was placed in handcuffs and moved behind the chain-linked fence.Baraka, to whom the appropriations law doesn’t apply, was held for a few hours before being released. It remains unclear why he was detained outside of the fenced-in area around the facility after he had already left the detention center.“I didn’t go there to break any laws. I didn’t break any laws,” Baraka told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Friday shortly after being released. “I was there as the mayor of the city, exercising my right and duty as an elected official, you know, supporting our congresspeople preparing for a press conference that was supposed to happen there.”DHS has doubled down on its response to the incident, writing inone social media post: “Just because the border is secure doesn’t mean you can find new walls to climb over guys.”CNN’s Shania Shelton contributed to this report.",

      "published_at": "2025-05-10 19:14",
      "content": "Nashville, Tennessee (AP) —More than 100 people have been taken into custody by federal immigration officials in a joint operation with the Tennessee Highway Patrol, leaving many in Nashville’s immigrant community uncertain and worried.“None of us have ever seen anything like this,” Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition said Friday.The operation with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a reminder of how local andstate law enforcement jurisdictionsare critical to President Donald Trump’splans for mass deportations. Last week,Florida officials touteda joint operation with ICE that resulted in 1,120 immigration arrests.The Highway Patrol said Friday that it made 588 stops in the joint operation with ICE, which took custody of 103 under investigation for immigration violations.The stops “led to the recovery of illegal drugs and firearms — taking dangerous elements off the street and making Tennessee safer,” the Highway Patrol said. One person was wanted in a killing in El Salvador.Tennessee’sGov. Bill Leerecently signed a law creating a division of immigration enforcement with the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which includes the Highway Patrol. He is one of a number of Republican officials pledging to use state resources to carry out Trump’s plans.Meanwhile, city officials in the Democratic stronghold of Nashville have disavowed involvement and been critical of the arrests. Nashville Law Director Wally Dietz said the state-federal operation, which began May 3, caught everyone in city government by surprise.A Department of Homeland Security building is seen Friday, May 9, 2025, in Nashville, Tenn.George Walker IV/APResponding to concerns about Nashville police presence outside an ICE office, Dietz said Wednesday that the city “routinely receives requests for extra patrols for a variety of reasons and responds to the extent resources are available.” He said he didn’t know who was detained and that, when he requested more information from the Highway Patrol, he was told to file a public records request.The Highway Patrol said stops are based solely on driver behavior. “We do not enter neighborhoods or stop vehicles based on who someone is — we stop based on what they do behind the wheel,” it said.But immigrant rights supporters contend that the patrols have focused on parts of the city where the majority of residents are people of color.“All signs point to this being racial profiling intended to terrorize the heart of the immigrant and refugee community,” Sherman Luna said. “What we’ve heard is that THP is flagging people down for things like a broken taillight or tinted windows.”Sherman Luna believes some of those being detained would be allowed to stay in the country if they were able to receive competent legal representation at an immigration hearing. Instead, she has heard that people are agreeing to be deported out of fear that they could spend months or years in immigration detention.About 9% of the Nashville metropolitan area population of about 2 million are immigrants, with many from Mexico and Honduras, according to the Migration Policy Institute’s analysis of census data. The city also has a large Kurdish population living alongside refugees from Sudan, Myanmar and other countries.“It’s a strategy to strike fear into our vibrant, diverse, beautiful neighborhoods,” Sherman Luna said.",

      "title": "What is habeas corpus, the legal procedure Trump is considering suspending? | CNN Politics",
      "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/10/politics/habeas-corpus-explained",
      "published_at": "2025-05-10 19:14",
      "content": "CNN—The future of habeas corpus has been pushed into the spotlight as President Donald Trump has beeninvolved in discussionsinside his administration over potentially taking the extreme step of suspending the procedure.What is habeas corpus?Habeas corpus is a legal principle that allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained or imprisoned to petition for their release in court.Immigrants and rights groups have filed habeas petitions in recent months as Trump has tried to speed up deportations as part of his immigration agenda.Still, habeas petitions are notoriouslydifficult to win in federal court, and it will be a challenge for most immigrants to obtain lawyers.How serious would suspending habeas corpus be?Lee Kovarsky, law professor at the University of Texas and expert on habeas corpus, said it would be a “national historical disaster.”“The executive could just detain you, and there would be no recourse,” he said. “Obviously they would do it to try to detain certain non citizens, but there’s no reason why it’s limited to them.”White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Friday the administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus and it “depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.”But the Constitution allows habeas corpus to be suspended only when “in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”“The Constitution makes clear that suspension of habeas corpus is to be reserved for actual rebellion or invasion posing the most dire threats to public safety. And Congress has never passed a law authorizing deportations without any court involvement, as Miller suggests,” CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said.Kovarsky said the reason why suspension of habeas corpus is so restricted “is precisely because it’s so severe.”“You have no right, to a court, to say that you’re being unlawfully detained. So in a way, the cash value of your substantive rights is zero if you don’t have a judge to evaluate them,” he said.What has the Supreme Court said about habeas corpus?The Supreme Court issued a murky, unsigned order on April 7 allowing Trump to use the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations for now while at the same time, the court said migrants subject to deportation under the act were entitled to notice and anopportunity to challenge their removalthrough federal habeas corpus petitions, marking a partial win for migrants.Following the Supreme Court’s decision, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a series of habeas lawsuits seeking to protect identified clients as well as “similarly situated” Venezuelans who could potentially be targeted under the Alien Enemies Act.The Supreme Court also issued a rareovernight orderon April 19thwhere a majority of justicesblocked the Trump administrationfrom deporting a group of immigrants in Texas.When has habeas corpus come up in other cases?Habeas corpus has been used in US courts including over issues with detaining alleged enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in recent years. The Supreme Court initially ruled in 2008 that detainees at the Guantanamo prison have the right to habeas corpus.In one case, a federal judge ruled in 2021 that the detention of one detainee being held at the US military prison in Guantanamo Baywas unlawful. The judge granted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to Asadullah Haroon Gul, who was accused of being a member of an extremist group.Gul, whom the US went on torepatriateto Afghanistan, became the first detainee at the Guantanamo Bay prison to win a habeas petition in 10 years.Another high-profile case related to habeas corpus involves Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist and legal permanent resident who was detained by immigration officers in March. Khalifiled a habeas corpus petitionto challenge the legality of his detention, and his case still faces legal challenges as he faces deportation.Has habeas corpus been suspended before?Habeas corpus has been suspended only four times in the history of the US, including by former President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.The other three times include “in eleven South Carolina counties overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction; in two provinces of the Philippines during a 1905 insurrection; and in Hawaii after the bombing of Pearl Harbor,” according tothe National Constitution Center.",

This brush with mortality has brought me a real gift — life is brief and beautiful.”The Oscar-winner recently wrapped his FX series “The Old Man” and is gearing up to appear in the third installment of the “Tron” franchise, out later this year.CNN’s Sandra Gonzalez contributed to this report.",

Sign up to receiveits biggest storiesas soon as they’re published.The pain jolted me awake. It was barely dawn, a misty February morning in 2023. My side felt as if I’d been stabbed.I had been dealing with pain for weeks — a bothersome ache that felt like a bad runner’s cramp. But now it was so intense I had to brace myself against the wall to stand up.A few hours after arriving at the emergency room, I heard my name. A doctor asked me to follow him to a private area, where he told me a scan had uncovered something “concerning.”There were lesions, areas of bone destruction, on top of both of my hip bones and on my sternum. These were hallmarks of multiple myeloma. “Cancer,” he said.Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer that ravages bone, leaving distinctive holes in its wake. Subsequent scans showed “innumerable lesions” from my neck to my feet as well as two broken ribs and a compression fracture in my spine. There is no cure.I walked out of the ER in search of fresh air. I sat on a metal bench and did what many patients do. I turned to Google. The first link was a medical review stating that the average lifespan of a newly diagnosed patient was three to five years. My stomach churned.I soon learned that information was outdated. Most patients today live much longer, in large part due to a drug with a horrific past. It was a doctor at the hospital who first told me I would likely take a thalidomide drug as part of my treatment.That couldn’t be possible, I told him.I knew the story of thalidomide, or at least I thought I did. It represented one of the darkest chapters in the history of modern medicine, having caused thousands of severe birth defects after it was given to pregnant women in the 1950s and 1960s. The drug was banned in most of the world, and the scandal gave rise to the modern-day U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Related articleWashington, DC - April 02 : Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty ImagesTrump signs directive on lowering drug prices even as he seeks tariffs on pharmaceuticalsIt turns out the drug once relegated to a pharmaceutical graveyard had new life as a cancer fighter.That drug I take is called Revlimid. It is a derivative of thalidomide, a slightly tweaked version of the parent compound.Revlimid is now one of the bestselling pharmaceutical products of all time, with total sales of more than $100 billion. It has extended tens of thousands of lives — including my own.But Revlimid is also, I soon learned, extraordinarily expensive, costing nearly $1,000 for each daily pill. (Although, I later discovered, a capsule costs just 25 cents to make.)That steep tab has put the drug’s lifesaving potential out of reach for some cancer patients, who have been forced into debt or simply stopped taking the drug. The price also helps fuel our ballooning insurance premiums.For decades,I’ve reported on outrageous health care costsin the U.S. and the burden they place on patients. I’ve revealed the tactics used by drug companies todrive salesand keep the price of their products high.Even with my experience, the cost of Revlimid stood out. When I started taking the drug, I’d look at the smooth, cylindrical capsule in my hand and consider the fact I was about to swallow something that costs about the same as a new iPhone. A month’s supply, which arrives in an ordinary, orange-tinged plastic bottle, is the same price as a new Nissan Versa.I wanted to know how this drug came to cost so much — and why the price keeps going up. The price of Revlimid has been hiked 26 times since it launched. Some of what happened was reported at the time. But no one has pieced together the full account of what the drugmaker Celgene did, how federal regulators failed to rein it in and what the story reveals about unrestrained drug pricing in America.What I discovered astonished even me.My journey started with an indefatigable New York City lawyer on a quest to give her dying husband a chance.ProPublicaTiny and terrifyingBeth Wolmer’s story begins on a moon-splashed beach in the Cayman Islands in the winter of 1995. She and her husband, Ira, were holding hands as they walked in the sand, enjoying a rare break from a hectic life as parents to a 1-year-old daughter and demanding jobs as 30-something professionals in New York City.They had met through friends and clicked from the start. On Sunday mornings, they sat together for hours, sharing sections of the newspaper and eating bagels. They planned trips to Europe and outings to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Ira was an interventional cardiologist who followed his father into medicine. Beth was a lawyer at the high-powered firm Skadden Arps.“We had a great life,” Beth told me. “I specifically remember coming home on the bus and thinking: ‘My life is just perfect, perfect. I’m not going to change a thing.’”As they walked that night in the Caribbean, Ira felt a sharp pain in his cheekbone. The pain flared several more times during the trip, becoming so intense that it brought tears to his eyes.When he got home, Ira made an appointment to figure out what was wrong. Imaging tests revealed multiple myeloma. The prognosis was grim. The couple was told Ira had two years to live.Specialists recommended treatments that would only provide a brief reprieve. The couple searched for someone who could offer something more. That’s when they found Dr. Bart Barlogie in Little Rock, Arkansas.Related articleWASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 07: U.S. President Donald Trump takes a question from a member of the media during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House on April 7, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Trump is meeting with Netanyahu to discuss ongoing efforts to release Israeli hostages from Gaza and newly imposed U.S. tariffs. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesTrump’s tariffs could make it harder to get certain generic drugsBarlogie had been recruited to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences from the more prestigious MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. In Texas, Barlogie had been frustrated by a medical culture that he viewed as too timid in its approach to multiple myeloma.He remembers working on a Sunday when a newly diagnosed patient was admitted to the hospital. With few options, Barlogie decided to put the patient on a taxing, four-drug chemotherapy cocktail used for lymphoma patients. It didn’t work. The patient died from a sepsis infection, a known complication of the treatment.The attending physician later admonished him, Barlogie said, saying, “Bart, we have to learn to treat myeloma gently.” Barlogie said he thought to himself, “Fuck you.”In Arkansas, Barlogie was in charge. He quickly developed a reputation as a practitioner willing to try anything to fight the fatal disease. Patients from around the world — including the actor Roy Scheider from the movie “Jaws” — flocked to his clinic.Beth and Ira heard Barlogie before they saw him. The cowboy boots he’d taken to donning since his time in Houston clacked down the linoleum hallway floors. A short, slight man, Barlogie had a booming voice with a German accent. He wore leather jackets and round, red-framed glasses on his bald head.When he strode into the exam room, he hugged Beth and Ira and told them they had come to the right place.Now retired, Barlogie recalls being struck by Beth’s intensity. He said she told him “you must do something” to help Ira.I met Barlogie at his home in Little Rock. We sat in his office, which is filled with photos of the red Ducati motorcycle he used to ride to work. An old license plate with the letters “MMCURED” sat on a shelf, reflecting his goal to find a cure for multiple myeloma.When Beth and Ira found him, Barlogie told me, he had been having some success with a novel approach that put patients through two stem cell transplants a few months apart, which he called a tandem stem cell transplant. With a transplant, a patient is bombarded with high-dose chemotherapy to kill the cancerous plasma cells. The patient is then infused with healthy stem cells that travel to the bone marrow.The intense chemotherapy can be grueling and poses a small risk of death.Ira underwent three transplants. Each time, he relapsed. By the fall of 1997, after two years of treatment, Ira’s thick black hair was gone. He was losing weight. Then he had a stroke. His kidneys failed and required dialysis. He developed pneumonia and had to be intubated.Beth was determined to keep him alive long enough for their toddler daughter to remember him. With a photograph of Ira smiling with their baby as motivation, she applied her lawyer’s tenacity to the case. She pored over medical journals and peppered oncologists with questions about why what they were trying wasn’t working or quizzing them about a promising study. When doctors told her there was nothing more they could do for her husband, she refused to accept it.“She is a tiny person, but she is terrifying,” said Dr. David Siegel, part of the team that treated Ira in Arkansas. “I’ve never been more scared of a spouse of a patient than I was of her.” He meant it as a compliment.By late fall in 1997, Ira was dying and Beth was desperate.A researcher told her about the work of Dr. Judah Folkman, a surgeon and researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital. Folkman believed the growth of cancerous tumors could be stunted by starving them of a supply of new blood vessels.ProPublica‘Thank you, God’Folkman was a workaholic who, when he wasn’t in the operating room or the research lab, was traveling across the world to promote his novel theory of how to attack cancer. Peers had ridiculed his idea since he first proposed it in the 1970s. The prevailing belief at the time was that tumors didn’t need a new blood supply to grow.A young researcher in his lab, an ophthalmologist named Robert D’Amato, was at work on the top question Folkman had posed. Could they come up with a drug, in pill form, that blocks the growth of new blood vessels?Folkman has since died, but it wasn’t difficult for me to track down D’Amato. He still works at Boston Children’s Hospital, where he has his own lab and holds the Judah Folkman Chair in Surgery. Now in his early 60s, D’Amato has a youthful energy and speaks in a rapid, matter-of-fact clip.D’Amato told me that he had set out to find existing drugs that block blood vessel growth. He started by thinking of his own body and side effects caused by certain drugs. A drug that causes hair loss might be the result of the blood supply to hair follicles being shut off, for example. But this exercise wasn’t producing any viable candidates.After giving it some thought, D’Amato realized he had myopically narrowed his search. What about a woman’s body? There were drugs that stopped menstrual cycles. Then there were drugs that caused birth defects in pregnant women. In both of those cases, it was possible the drug was inhibiting blood vessel growth. He came up with a list of 10 drugs. At the top of the list was one with a devastating history: thalidomide.Beginning in the 1950s, pregnant women in Europe, Australia and other countries were frequently prescribed thalidomide as a treatment for morning sickness and to help them sleep. The drug was thought to be harmless and in Germany was sold over the counter. An advertisement for thalidomide in the United Kingdom claimed it could “be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child.”They were wrong.Related articleA scene from a video provided by Akeso shows part of their production facilities.Courtesy AkesoA little-known Chinese company made a drug that beat the world’s biggest-selling medicineThe drug was eventually linked to birth defects in more than 10,000 babies. Those babies were born without limbs or with shortened limbs, malformed hands, disfigured faces and damage to internal organs. Nearly half died within months of being born.By the early 1960s, the drug was widely banned, considered a shameful chapter in the history of pharmaceuticals. It was never sold in the U.S. thanks to the unwavering objections of a resolute reviewer at the FDA named Frances Oldham Kelsey. The close call, however, prompted Congress to require more rigorous safety and efficacy data from drug manufacturers and empower the FDA to monitor the industry more closely.D’Amato theorized that the thalidomide birth defects were the result of the drug stopping the growth of new blood vessels that the fetus needs to develop. He walked me through his experiments: He cracked a fertilized chicken egg on a glass petri dish and placed thalidomide on the surface. After two days, if no blood vessels grow on the embryo, a halo should appear around the thalidomide sample, showing the drug worked. It didn’t.Folkman told D’Amato to move on. But D’Amato couldn’t shake the disappointing results. He did more research and realized thalidomide needs to first be broken down in the body to have an effect on humans. He purchased metabolites of thalidomide, repeated the test and this time found a halo around the sample.He kept experimenting and in 1994 published a paper finding that thalidomide had “clear implications” for treating tumors.So when Beth called three years later, Folkman told her they should try it.Barlogie told me he didn’t think it would work. Beth said she had to convince him to try it.Barlogie agreed to test it on Ira and two other patients who were out of treatment options in early December.The drug did not work for Ira. Beth said just before he died, Ira sat up in bed, kissed her and smiled. It was March 10, 1998. He was 38.Related articleThe Federal Trade Commission issued a second interim report on pharmacy benefit managers on Tuesday.Benoit Tessier/ReutersFTC finds middlemen inflate specialty generic drug prices by billions of dollarsAfter years of frantically searching for anything that would help, the finality of his death was difficult to accept, she said. “I wanted him alive forever.”It is unclear what happened with the second patient. The third patient, however, started to get better.His name was Jimmy. Little more is known about him except that he was a patient of another oncologist at the hospital, Dr. Seema Singhal, and near death before he started the drug. “I told him it might work, but at the very least it would help him sleep,” Singhal said. Shortly after Jimmy took his first dose of thalidomide, Singhal left for a vacation.Dr. Bart Barlogie and Dr. Seema SinghalPainting by James Lee Chiahan for ProPublicaWhen she returned two weeks later, her mailbox was full of lab results for Jimmy. He was still alive. She sat down to double-check the results, which showed declining amounts of a cancer marker. “For 30 minutes, I was the only person in the world who knew this worked,” she said.Singhal walked down to Barlogie’s office to give him the news. “He took me by the hand, opened a window and shouted, ‘Thank you, God,’” she said.ProPublica‘Violent arguments’Word of Jimmy’s stunning recovery in Arkansas quickly made its way to the offices of Celgene Corp., located in a small corporate park in a rural patch of northern New Jersey.The company had just wrapped up a brutal year-end accounting, which showed losses of $27 million on revenue of just $1.1 million. Money was so tight that executives engaged in what one of them called “violent arguments” over whether to charge employees for coffee.Celgene had acquired the rights to thalidomide patents held by researchers at Rockefeller University in 1992. The company, which was new to pharmaceuticals, planned to use the experience of obtaining FDA approval for thalidomide to develop other drugs.“It wasn’t meant to be a blockbuster,” said Sol Barer, who started at the company in 1987 and later became CEO.When Celgene announced plans to develop the disgraced drug for new uses, the only analyst following the company on Wall Street dropped coverage and told Celgene officials they didn’t know what they were doing.The company thought the largest market would be as a treatment for AIDS patients experiencing dangerous weight loss. To win approval of the drug, however, Celgene selected a use that was already in practice in parts of the world for a small group of patients.In July 1998, the FDA approved thalidomide for the treatment of a painful complication of leprosy. It was a momentous decision, coming just a few decades after the drug caused so much harm.The market for leprosy was tiny, but what happened with Jimmy in Arkansas changed everything for the company.ProPublicaBlocked exitsThe Arkansas doctors had been busy since first testing thalidomide on Ira Wolmer, Jimmy and the other patient. They quickly got approval to conduct a larger experiment funded by a grant from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Now, in December 1998, they were ready to share their initial findings at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology.It had been three decades since a new therapy for multiple myeloma had been approved, and there was a buzz among the oncologists gathered in Miami Beach for the conference. So many doctors crowded into the room for the presentation that the fire marshal had to intervene several times to clear exit ways. Word had already spread among multiple myeloma specialists about Jimmy. Now, the assembled doctors wanted to know whether it had been a fluke or a discovery that would fundamentally change how they practiced.Singhal was tasked with presenting the data. It was a big stage for the 32-year-old doctor, who had only been practicing in the U.S. for two years.The 89 patients in the study were high-risk cases who had undergone prior treatment. They were patients who, like Ira, had run out of options. Now, after thalidomide treatment, one-third had declines in myeloma activity.Those were stunning numbers, unlike anything seen before in the treatment of multiple myeloma. When Singhal finished, the room erupted in applause.Related articleSen.

While I waited, the pain worsened. Painkillers barely made a dent. All I could picture was this cancer eating away at my bones, doing more damage every day.David ArmstrongPainting by James Lee Chiahan for ProPublicaSome patients wait months for care. I was lucky enough to meet my oncologist within weeks. He had a script for Revlimid ready to go, part of a regimen of four drugs I would take as standard induction therapy, and I was able to start it within days.The initial dose of Revlimid cost $18,255 for a month’s supply, and my insurance covered the cost.Within a month, my blood tests showed a massive drop in a key cancer indicator.My pain gradually subsided too. By the end of April, I wrote in my journal that the pain was a 3 or 4 instead of the usual 9 or 10. “It doesn’t hurt to get out of bed anymore,” I wrote.ProPublicaA piggy bankThe discovery in Arkansas made thalidomide, which Celgene sold as Thalomid, an instant hit.As a result, Celgene’s revenue increased nearly sevenfold to $26.2 million in the year after the Miami presentation. It sold its thalidomide pills for $7.50 each.From those modest beginnings, Celgene took a slightly altered version of that pill and turned it into one of the bestselling and most expensive prescription drugs in history. Celgene’s success with Thalomid was the result of remarkable good fortune, a case where the heavy lifting of discovery and initial testing had already been done, by Beth Wolmer, D’Amato, Barlogie, Singhal and others.The development of the drug that would become Revlimid took me deep into the confounding, sharp-elbowed world of drug patents, which ostensibly protect drugmakers, allowing them to recoup the massive investments they made in developing a new product. Celgene drew on patent law, a drug safety system and even patient assistance programs to guard the exclusivity of its prized drug and the massive revenue it generated.Those tactics, detailed in reams of court filings, allowed Celgene to treat Revlimid like a piggy bank, tapping it whenever it wanted.Amid the early success of Thalomid, Celgene identified two potential threats: One was obvious. Thalidomide caused birth defects, a looming risk that could result in it being pulled from the market.The other was that Celgene held limited patents on the drug. Patents are exclusive legal rights to inventions, and researchers file them on nearly every aspect of drug development as soon as they can, locking up everything from specific sets of ingredients to the way the drug is used and administered. The more robust patents a company has, the longer it can potentially ward off competitors.Thalidomide was an old drug and Celgene’s patents did not cover the active ingredient, leaving it open to competition. The patents it did have, covering items such as the optimal dosages and its use in treating particular diseases, were considered weaker and open to a court challenge. If Celgene could create a new version of thalidomide — ideally one that didn’t cause birth defects — the company could seek more and stronger patents that would extend beyond those of the original drug.So researchers at Celgene tested analogs of thalidomide, which are drugs that have a similar effect but are different from the parent compound in minor ways, such as having one less oxygen atom. The analogs are also more potent than the original, meaning they can achieve a similar effect at lower doses.Celgene was not alone in its efforts. D’Amato was also studying thalidomide analogs and filing patents on their use, which he and Boston Children’s Hospital licensed to a Celgene competitor, EntreMed Inc.With dueling patents, the companies sued each other in 2002.Celgene was newly flush with cash from rising sales of thalidomide. EntreMed, on the other hand, was burning through money as it focused most of its resources on developing other drugs discovered in Folkman’s lab.In December of 2002, the companies settled.Celgene agreed to pay Boston Children’s Hospital royalties from future sales of Revlimid. In exchange, the hospital and D’Amato licensed their patents of thalidomide analogs to Celgene. Celgene also agreed to pay EntreMed $27 million.For Celgene, the fight with EntreMed was a valuable experience. It learned that competition can be neutralized.ProPublicaThe rise of RevlimidCelgene had kept the price of Thalomid low when it was initially intended for AIDS patients, CEO John Jackson told investors in 2004, as the company “didn’t want huge numbers of people demonstrating in front” of its office.That wasn’t a problem with cancer patients. There was “plenty of room for very substantial increases” in the price of the drug now, Jackson told investors.Just two days earlier, Celgene had hiked the price of Thalomid to $47 a pill.“There was a common internal theme at Celgene that cancer patients were willing to pay almost any amount Celgene charged,” wrote David Schmidt, a former national account manager at the company, in a whistleblower lawsuit he filed after his employment was terminated in 2008. The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed by Schmidt. (Jackson didn’t respond to requests for comment; Schmidt declined to talk to me.)When Celgene launched Revlimid in December of 2005, it set the initial price at $55,000 a year, or $218 a pill, which was about double what analysts expected.Seven months later, when the FDA approved the drug for multiple myeloma, the price jumped to $70,560 a year, or $280 a pill.The cost to manufacture each Revlimid pill, meanwhile, was 25 cents. I found a deposition marked “highly confidential” in which a top Celgene executive testified that the cost started at a quarter and never changed.Even on Wall Street, which cheered higher pricing, the initial cost of Revlimid prompted concern among analysts who tracked the company that such aggressive maneuvering would cause insurers to push back. In the U.S., that is one of the only real checks on the price of prescription drugs.That fear turned out to be unfounded, and Celgene would repeatedly test the bounds of how high it could go.At the same time, Celgene worked to mute any criticism of Revlimid.Related articleWASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 08: U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to speak at the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) dinner at the National Building Museum on April 08, 2025 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesTrump drug tariffs would drive up prices, worsen shortages before any boost to US manufacturing, experts warnIn 2005, Celgene received reports that Los Angeles oncologist Dr. James Berenson was “bashing” Revlimid in presentations sponsored by patient groups.In one email, a senior company official said, “it is time for us to take Jimbo to the wood shed.” The company discussed a range of options for dealing with the doctor, from taking legal action to arranging a sit-down with Celgene’s chief executive.Ultimately, the company appears to have decided on a friendlier course of action. Berenson became a frequent paid speaker and consultant for the company, with payments totaling at least $333,000, according to Celgene disclosures. Berenson declined to comment.He wasn’t the only doctor the company befriended. Payment records show that between 2013 and 2018, Celgene paid doctors $11 million for speaking engagements and consulting work related to Revlimid. At one point, Celgene rented a suite at the Houston Astros baseball stadium to throw a party for the entire multiple myeloma department at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, according to court testimony. The center said it was unable to verify any of those details.Celgene went on to spread its largesse across the multiple myeloma world. It funded patient groups, sponsored medical meetings and contracted with prestigious academic medical centers.“They remind me of an octopus with many, many tentacles, and at the end of each tentacle is a wad of cash,” said David Mitchell, a former Washington, D.C., communications executive who launched a nonprofit organization to fight for lower prices after he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. “Everybody relies on the money.” Mitchell said his group, Patients For Affordable Drugs, does not accept donations from any entity that profits from the development or distribution of pharmaceuticals.At the same time it showered doctors and patient groups with money, Celgene was shutting Beth Wolmer out. She told me that John Jackson, the CEO at the time, had promised her a paid board seat at the company as a way of compensating her for her role in the discovery before the company cut off communication.Wolmer sued Celgene in federal court in 2009, seeking $300 million or more for alleged misappropriation of her idea and what she termed the “unjust enrichment” of Celgene.Celgene said it never promised to compensate Wolmer. The company also suggested she greatly inflated her role in the discovery and, in any event, waited too long to take legal action.In 2010, a judge granted Celgene’s motion for summary judgment in the case, agreeing that the statute of limitations had expired while at the same time expressing “admiration” for Wolmer’s “contribution to the struggle against this terrible disease.”Ira and Beth Wolmer in the Cayman IslandsPainting by James Lee Chiahan for ProPublicaWolmer has remarried and changed her name to Jacobson. She remains disappointed about the way she was treated by Celgene. “There was no ambiguity about who found the purpose of this drug, and I’m thrilled that it’s helping so many people,” she said. “Why they treated me that way? I don’t know.”ProPublicaThe generic threatAfter the FDA approved Revlimid in late 2005, it also granted Celgene something else: seven years of market exclusivity because the drug treats a rare disease. In those seven years, Celgene raised the price of the drug nine times, increasing the price per pill by 82% to $397 in 2012.The company also fended off challengers by claiming its patents protected the drug from competition until 2027.But by 2010 generic makers were already working on copies of the drug, preparing to challenge those patents and enter the market earlier. A government analysis has found that generics generally lower the price of brand name drugs by an average of 85% after just one year.Celgene was well aware of the danger generics posed and warned in a 2012 financial filing that their entry into the market could have a “material adverse effect” on its finances. At that point, Revlimid sales made up 70% of the company’s revenue.Celgene needed another move.The drug still posed a risk of birth defects like the parent compound. In approving the drug, the FDA had mandated a strict safety program to control its prescription and distribution.Celgene realized early on that this could also be a tool to thwart competition. An internal company presentation at the time noted that the safety program could make it “more difficult for generic companies to access” thalidomide for testing.Generic drug makers are required by the FDA to test their version against the brand name drug, so they need to buy small amounts of Revlimid from the company.By 2012, at least six generic makers had requested to purchase Revlimid for testing. In every case, Celgene refused.Federal regulators took notice. The FDA had warned Celgene that it could not use the safety program “to block or delay approval” of generic competitors. Now, it appeared to be doing just that.The Federal Trade Commission, which enforces antitrust laws, had been investigating Celgene for years and in June of 2012 notified the company it was poised to take action.In a previously unreported letter, the FTC said that its staff had recommended filing a legal complaint against the company for refusing to sell to competitors, thereby keeping them out of the marketplace.In its letter, the FTC noted that while Celgene refused to sell its drugs to potential competitors, it routinely provided Revlimid to other third parties around the world, including researchers and universities studying the drug.Then, in August of 2012, the FDA directed Celgene to sell a small amount of Revlimid to a generic competitor.With both federal agencies bearing down on Celgene, a closed-door meeting was held at FDA headquarters at the end of August. The FTC sent five lawyers, and 11 FDA staffers attended. Celgene showed up with a large contingent that included in-house lawyers and outside counsel.Celgene started by denying it was using the safety program to block generics, according to minutes of the meeting. (The minutes were filed in a court case against Celgene, and it is unclear if they were prepared by the agencies or the company.) Citing the threat of birth defects, the company said that it had legitimate safety concerns about selling Revlimid to generic companies and that it needed to protect its investment in the drug.Jane Axelrad, an associate director for the FDA, told Celgene that it was raising safety concerns because “the company does not want generics on the market,” according to the minutes. She declined to comment.The meeting ended without a resolution. The FDA had no way of enforcing its directive to Celgene. The FTC staff, however, was still determined to act. The agency had spent more than two years investigating Celgene. It hired experts, deposed Celgene officials and obtained internal company documents.The staff drafted a complaint alleging the company engaged in unfair actions to maintain a monopoly, hoping either that it would push the company to agree to sell to competitors to avoid legal action or that Celgene would be forced to do so by the courts, according to a person familiar with the agency’s stance.“The commission’s patience is wearing thin,” FTC official Richard Feinstein wrote to the company’s lawyer in February 2013. “We have reached a point where the staff may be instructed in the very near future to commence litigation.” (Feinstein did not respond to emails seeking a comment.)Celgene appeared to relent, telling the FTC that it would sell to generic makers, as long as the FDA approved their safety plan. In July, the FDA approved the safety protocols of generic maker Mylan.Still, Celgene refused to sell.Related articleOlivia and Keira Riley, two sisters that share the same genetic condition.Courtesy Kendra RileyA lifesaving therapy for children with a rare disease is now the world’s most expensive drug, raising questions about accessJon Leibowitz, who was the chairman of the FTC at the time, told me that Celgene’s promise to cooperate, even if it didn’t result in any sales to generic makers, lessened interest in the case among his fellow commissioners. Three of five commissioners need to vote in favor of commencing litigation. Now, in retrospect, he said that “if we knew then what we know now” about the delays, “we certainly would have brought a case.”The agency would close its case in 2017 without taking any action.With would-be generic competitors sidelined by Celgene’s refusal to sell drugs for testing, the company continued to raise the price of Revlimid.On a Saturday morning in early March of 2014, Celgene President Mark Alles sent an internal email complaining of disappointing first quarter Revlimid sales. Revenue from the star drug, which had surpassed $1 billion the previous quarter, was down by about 1% — or $11.4 million.“I have to consider every legitimate opportunity available to us to improve our Q1 performance,” he wrote. But the only idea he proposed was a familiar one: raise the price of the drug.Alles said he wanted a meeting the following Monday to discuss an immediate 4% price increase, followed by another increase of 3% at the beginning of September.The company implemented those hikes, along with a third in December. It brought the price of Revlimid to $9,854 a month, or $469 a pill, and helped boost Revlimid sales for the year to $5 billion. Alles didn’t respond to my requests for comment.“They could raise their price any time they wanted to,” said Francis Brown, a former sales executive at the company, in a 2015 deposition. I wasn’t able to reach Brown for comment.Celgene found a solution to the generic threat when it struck a deal to settle a lawsuit brought by generic maker NATCO Pharma in 2015. NATCO could bring a generic to market, Celgene agreed, but not for seven more years — in March 2022. Even then, the generic would be limited to less than 10% of the total market for Revlimid in the first year, with gradual increases after that.The deal set the bar for deals with other rivals for limited generic sales, and it ensured that unlimited generic competition — and lower prices — would not arrive until 2026.The delayed entry of generics may have been bad news for patients and health care payors, but there was one constituency that was thrilled with the 2015 deal. Celgene’s stock jumped nearly 10% the day after it was announced.ProPublica‘Ridiculous,’ ‘Ugly’ and ‘Killer’Revlimid turned out to be a unicorn for Celgene, a drug whose financial success proved impossible to replicate.In October of 2017, Celgene announced it was abandoning a once-promising effort to develop a drug for Crohn’s disease. Shares of Celgene declined by 11%.As it had done so many times in the past, Celgene tapped Revlimid to try to mitigate the damage. The day it announced the failure of the Crohn’s drug, it quietly raised the price of Revlimid by 9%.By the end of the year, Celgene had cumulatively raised the cost 20% to $662 a pill, the largest one-year increase in the drug’s history.That made Revlimid the most expensive Medicare drug that year, with the government insurance program spending $3.3 billion to provide it to 37,459 patients.At Celgene, the brash increases triggered rare internal dissent. Betty Swartz, the company’s vice president of U.S. market access, objected to the measures in a pricing meeting with the CEO, who at the time was Alles, and other top executives. She said her concerns were swiftly dismissed, according to a whistleblower lawsuit she filed and later dismissed.“Why would you be afraid to take an increase on our products?” she said the CEO told her. “What could be the worst thing that happens … a tweet here or there and bad press for a bit.” Swartz declined to comment.The price increases added to the burden faced by many patients. In online groups, patients use words like “ridiculous,” “ugly” and “killer” when talking about the financial pain they have experienced related to the high costs associated with Revlimid. Some have taken out mortgages, raided retirement funds or cut back on everyday expenses like groceries to pay for Revlimid. Others have found overseas suppliers who ship the drug for pennies on the dollar, although doctors caution there’s no way to guarantee quality. Some just decide not to take the drug.By increasing the price of Revlimid, Celgene executives in several instances boosted their pay. That’s because bonuses were tied to meeting revenue and earnings targets. In some years, executives would not have hit those targets without the Revlimid price increases, a congressional investigation later found.In total, Celgene paid a handful of top executives about a half-billion dollars in the 12 years after Revlimid was approved.Robert Hugin, who worked as Celgene’s CEO and then executive chairman, received $51 million in total compensation from 2015 to 2017. Hugin retired in 2018 to launch an unsuccessful Senate bid.Even sales reps earned more than $1 million a year and were rewarded with trips to resorts such as the Four Seasons in Maui. That pay is more than two times what the average oncologist earns.Related articleSenator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) speaks during a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing entitled \"Strengthening Airline Operations and Consumer Protections,\"  focusing on the holiday meltdown, that forced Southwest to cancel thousands of flights, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 9, 2023. REUTERS/Amanda Andrade-RhoadesAmanda Andrade-Rhoades/ReutersFirst on CNN: Klobuchar questions drug company behind 10-fold spike in price of lead poisoning antidoteI connected with Hugin just before Christmas while he was driving. He was ardent in his defense of the pricing of Revlimid. He told me the drug passes any cost-benefit analysis because of its impact on multiple myeloma patients like myself. “People recognize when you have a breakthrough therapy and you have an opportunity to deliver that, you want to deliver that across the world,” he said. “And I think Revlimid is an example of a product that ends up to be a global lifesaver because of what it did.”Hugin told me that when Revlimid has unlimited generic competition, the price will be “cheaper than aspirin” and patients will benefit from that low price for many decades.Celgene also cited the cost of developing drugs and its expansive research efforts as reasons for the high cost of Revlimid. Celgene said it spent $800 million to develop Revlimid and spent several hundred million more on additional trials to study the use of the drug in other cancers. Those combined figures represent about 2% to 3% of Revlimid sales through 2018.By the end of 2018, Celgene’s stock was down 56% over the past 15 months amid development failures. Despite the raft of bad news, Alles’ total pay that year increased by $3 million to $16.2 million.Celgene tried desperately to boost its flagging stock price by buying back $6 billion of its own shares that year.Ultimately, the buyback was not enough. Just days into the new year in 2019, Celgene announced it had agreed to be acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb in a deal valued at $74 billion.As part of a severance agreement, top Celgene executives stood to make millions once the deal closed. For Alles, that meant a potential estimated payday of $27.9 million.In the fall of 2020, Alles appeared before the House Oversight Committee, which was investigating the high cost of prescription drugs. He said pricing decisions “reflected our commitment to patient access, the value of a medicine to patients and the health care system, the continuous effort to discover new medicines and new uses for existing medicines, and the need for financial flexibility.”When it came time for questions, then-Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., quizzed Alles in rapid-fire style about Revlimid. Did the drug change as the price increased? Did it work faster? Were there fewer side effects? The drug was the same, Alles responded.“So, to recap here,” Porter said. “The drug didn’t get any better. The cancer patients didn’t get any better. You just got better at making money. You just refined your skills at price gouging.”ProPublicaThe drumbeat continuesHigh prices have consequences beyond individual patients. While there have been tremendous advancements in the treatment of my disease, there is still no cure. The specter of relapse hovers over every blood test, every new ache or pain.The day I learned I was in remission, in November 2023, was bittersweet. I wrote at the time that I didn’t get to ring a bell — the traditional sign that a cancer patient has finished treatment. Instead, my doctor explained the next step: “maintenance” treatment.This includes not only continuing Revlimid, but making monthly visits to my cancer center to get a shot of a bone-strengthening drug, have another drug injected into my stomach and blood drawn for lab tests.“The visit,” I wrote that day, “only reinforced the fact that I’m a patient, and I always will be.”For most of us, cancer will return at some point after treatment. And for most patients, the drugs eventually stop working.Revlimid can also be difficult to live with. Some patients quit the drug after developing severe gastrointestinal issues, infections or liver problems. The drug also poses an increased risk of stroke, heart attack and secondary cancers.Those are the trade-offs for keeping multiple myeloma in check.Meanwhile, the drumbeat of price increases continues under Bristol Myers Squibb, helping the company bring in $48 billion in revenue from Revlimid since it purchased Celgene. Bristol said its pricing “reflects the continued clinical benefit Revlimid brings to patients, along with other economic factors.” The company said it is “committed to achieving unfettered patient access to our medicines” and provides some financial support for eligible patients. “While BMS develops prices for its medicines, we do not determine what patients will pay out of pocket.”Last July, the cost of my monthly Revlimid prescription increased by 7% to $19,660.At the beginning of this year, my insurer switched me to generic Revlimid. I didn’t fight it, thinking it would result in a dramatic decrease in what ProPublica’s health plan pays for the drug.It turns out it is not much of a savings: The generic costs $17,349 a month.Alec Glassfordcontributed research.",

      "content": "CNN—A ceasefire agreed between India and Pakistan appears to be holding, with both sides stressing their commitment to the surprise truce which halted the worst fighting in decades between the nuclear-armed neighbors.The flare-up was triggered by a massacre of tourists last month in Indian-administered Kashmir. Cross-border military strikes began on Wednesday and have left dozens of people dead.There were reports of violations from both sides soon after the ceasefire was announced on Saturday, although CNN understands that since then it has been holding.US President Donald Trump was the first to announce the ceasefire and claimed credit for Washington’s role in securing it, but contradictory accounts have emerged about the extent of US involvement.Here’s what you need to know.How did the truce come about?Just before 8 a.m. ET on Saturday, about 5 p.m. in India and Pakistan, Trump announced the ceasefire in a post on Truth Social.“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE,” Trump said, congratulating the leaders of both countries for “using common sense and great intelligence.”Soon after, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed that India and Pakistan had not only agreed to a ceasefire, but also “to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.” Rubio said that the ceasefire came after he and Vice President JD Vance spent the past two days speaking with senior officials from both countries.Both sides confirmed the agreement soon after.Video Ad FeedbackCNN correspondents explain what we know about the India and Pakistan ceasefire05:52- Source:CNNCNN correspondents explain what we know about the India and Pakistan ceasefire05:52India’s Ministry of Information said the agreement was worked out “directly between the two countries,” downplaying US involvement and contradicting Trump’s claim. The ministry also said there was “no decision” to hold further talks.But Pakistani officials have heaped praise on Washington.“We thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region,” said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.A Pakistani source familiar with the negotiations told CNN that the US – and Rubio in particular – was instrumental in striking the deal, painting a picture of talks that were in doubt right until the truce was confirmed.The deal was all the more surprising given fighting continued Saturday, with both sides accusing each other of attacking military bases, raising fears of further escalation.Why the differing accounts?It should not be surprising that these bitter rivals have given contradictory accounts of how the ceasefire was reached.India, which views itself as a regional superpower, has long been resistant to international mediation, whereas Pakistan, which is heavily dependent on foreign aid, tends to welcome it, analysts say.“India has never accepted mediation in any dispute, be it India-Pakistan or India-China, or any other,” said Dr. Aparna Pande, research fellow for India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC.“Pakistan, on the other hand, has always sought international mediation so they will praise it,” she added, saying it is “the only way it can put pressure on India to discuss and resolve the Kashmir dispute.”The fighting before Saturday’s ceasefire was marked by claims, counterclaims and disinformation from both sides. Now that the conflict has paused, both sides are ramping up their efforts to shape perceptions of what the fighting achieved and how it ended.On Sunday, India’s defense minister said New Delhi had sent a bold message to terrorists, while the country’s air force hailed its “precision and professionalism.”A man walks past a house damaged by Pakistan's strikes on Jammu, a city in India-administered Kashmir, on Saturday.Adnan Abidi/ReutersWhat was the trigger for the crisis?This round of fighting began in Kashmir, a disputed region that has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both countries gained their independence from Britain in 1947.The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India – Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan – both claim Kashmir in full, despite only controlling parts of it. Months after becoming independent, they fought the first of their three wars over the territory.On April 22, gunmen opened fire on sightseers in a popular travel destination in the mountainous destination of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. At least 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali were killed in the massacre.New Delhi immediately blamed Islamabad, accusing it of supporting “cross-border terrorism.” Pakistan has denied all involvement in the attack.Two weeks after the Pahalgam massacre, India on Wednesday launched a series of strikes on Pakistan and the parts of Kashmir it holds, calling the attack “Operation Sindoor.”The theater of conflict since then has been far broader than in previous rounds of fighting, with both sides striking deep into the other’s territory.Why did the US get involved?Just two days ago, JD Vance downplayed the potential for US influence as the India-Pakistan conflict spiralled.“What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of a war that’s fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it,” Vance told Fox News on Thursday.Vance’s about-face is a measure of how concerned the US – and the wider international community – became by the escalating conflict between the two nuclear powers.Trump administration officials told CNN that, after receiving alarming intelligence on Friday about the extent to which the conflict could escalate, the State Department felt it had no choice but to play a greater role in talks between the two sidesWill the ceasefire hold?While initially appearing fragile, both sides appear to be upholding the terms of the ceasefire into Sunday.India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of repeatedly violating the ceasefire agreement on Saturday, after explosions were heard in both the India- and Pakistan-administered parts of Kashmir.Pakistan also accused India of committing violations but stressed it “remains committed to a faithful implementation of the ceasefire.”Since then, CNN understands there have been no fresh missile strikes or drone flights. However, an Indian defense source told CNN Sunday that the air force’s operational readiness is still high.In the wake of the tourist massacre, the two announced a host of other reprisals: suspending visas, banning trade, while India suspended its participation in a crucial water-sharing pact. It is unclear yet whether such moves will be reversed.Correction: This piece has been updated with the correct date for the tourist massacre in India-administered Kashmir.CNN’s Rhea Mogul, Sophia Saifi, Esha Mitra, Aditi Sangal, Nic Robertson, Alayne Treene, Aishwarya S.

      "content": "Kyiv, UkraineCNN—It was a proposal that the Kremlin could neither outright reject nor accept, intended to force it into an awkward choice, revealing Russian PresidentVladimir Putin’s true appetite for his brutal war of choice.Europe’s leaders have grasped the nettle of whetherpeace talksover Ukraine can lead anywhere meaningful, to force Moscow into a pause in violence, precisely when it seems to seek to escalate assaults in the summer months ahead.It also gave Europe’s largest army – Ukraine - the unenviable task of preparing in just over 30 hours their frontline forces for perhaps a month of tense peace, and then hopefully weeks of serious negotiation, in which the borders of their country will be decided.Ultimately, Ukraine, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland faced little choice: the Trump administration’s very public loss of patience – sometimes with Moscow, but also less justifiably with Kyiv – carried the risk of the White House simply “moving on.” That could lead to the United States dropping aid to Ukraine, together with their efforts for a peaceful solution – a potential disaster for European security.The past week’s clear enormous diplomatic lifting by French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and of course Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky himself, has put the White House in a position where it has had to back a direct European bid to take control of the outcome of the biggest war on the continent since the 1940s.Europe is indeed forcing on Russia a proposal initially made by the US and Ukraine – the 30-day unconditional ceasefire first offered after a bilateral meeting in Saudi Arabia almost two months ago. But they are also forcing the White House to step up, monitor the truce, and then back tough consequences – Macron called them “massive sanctions” – if the initiative falls apart.Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, France's President Emmanuel Macron and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky take a walk after visiting St. Sophia Cathedral,in Kyiv on May 10, 2025.Ludovic Marin/Pool via ReutersPutin’s answered by simply stating he did not believe Ukraine had honored the previous ceasefires Moscow had unilaterally called, and that Kyiv has said Moscow never respected either. And he suggested something old as something new: the idea of direct talks, already consented to in differing terms by both sides, concretely in Istanbul on Thursday. Macron and Zelensky were clear the offer was not enough and a ceasefire must precede talks.The Kremlin was in a place where it needed to agree, dispute, or ignore the proposal. It chose to contrive, as it has in the past, a complex fudge of a response. Putin seemed to refuse to address the proposal directly and offered perhaps enough to suggest to Trump he is interested in peace, but not enough to suggest European pressure is working.“Kir,\" a member of the National Guard of Ukraine, sits by a monitor showing a number of camera feeds.CNNRelated articleUkrainians on front line say Russians keep breaking Putin’s ceasefireThis is the most significant diplomatic moment of the war, perhaps the most important declaration of the conflict yet, and certainly the most important 36 hours since Putin faced a rebellion from his top aide Yevgeny Prigozhin in June 2023. Time is a serious problem: something that has to last 30 days must be built in 30 hours.Gigantic questions remain for Ukraine and its allies as to how this ceasefire comes into effect. Can Kyiv order its forces to not fight back in self-defense? If the US is to monitor the truce, as Macron suggested, does it have the capabilities in place, in adequate quality and quantity, to study hundreds of miles of violent frontlines? Precise evidence of Moscow’s infractions will be key to helping Ukraine and Europe respond to the inevitable wave of Russian misinformation and recrimination that may accompany a truce.The cost for Kyiv and Europe of the next month could be significant. Ukraine could lose ground as its troops soften their responses to Russian assaults during a ceasefire. The White House might emerge from the process and again swing back on its pendulum to a place where it believes Zelensky is the problem. Europe’s unity – on display remarkably today in Kyiv, and backed by over a dozen other countries from New Zealand to Canada – can only worsen from its current peak, especially if American support for Ukraine ebbs.But the cost of doing nothing – as was the case in the Europe of the 1930s – was higher. Trump losing patience with perhaps the most complex item on his portfolio would likely be damaging for Kyiv, more than for Moscow. Putin having another two months to pick away at Kyiv’s frontlines would leave Zelensky facing another ghastly winter.Servicemen of Special Police Battalion walk at their positions, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine April 29, 2025.ReutersUkraine and its European allies seek clarity from this proposal on whether Putin wants any kind of peace at all. The path they have chosen to get there is in itself unclear, and deeply fraught with potholes of Putin’s manipulation.Listening to the heads of Europe’s five largest militaries in Kyiv Saturday, it appeared most had made their mind up that Putin does not want peace and won’t genuinely contemplate a month of it. These five leaders face a tricky few weeks of establishing that fact, and then the messy persuasion of Trump that he must take an even tougher position on Russia than his predecessor, Joe Biden.The path ahead that Europe’s leaders appear to envisage is of a worsening of the war – where Putin violates a ceasefire, is hit with “massive sanctions,” and Europe must escalate its military backing for Ukraine. They do not appear to think the Kremlin wants the war to stop. The weeks ahead are designed, it seems, for a future in which they must prove to Trump he is being misled, and drag his White House permanently and irrefutably into their camp.",

      "content": "CNN—Sasha had only heard a little about South Carolina, and even less about the town of Hartsville, when he and his family moved there in September 2022.They were forced to suddenly leave behind their life in Kyiv because ofthe war with Russia. They are not the only Ukrainians in the “small, rural community” where they have been welcomed and begun to rebuild their lives.“For me, the United States, it was like a fortress of democracy, of freedom, of opportunities, and I thought, finally, finally, I’m in the place where I can begin my life all over again,” Sasha, who is not using his last name for fear of reprisal, told CNN.Sasha, his wife and his young daughter are among the approximately 280,000 Ukrainians who have relocated to the United States through “Uniting for Ukraine” (U4U), a US government humanitarian parole program that allowed private US citizens to sponsor and help support Ukrainian refugees.Now, Sasha’s family and scores of others who came to the US under the U4U program fear their lives may once again be uprooted, as decisions on parole extensions, temporary protected status, and work authorizations have been paused amid the Trump administration’s sweeping changes to the immigration system.“This really could be catastrophic, not just for the Ukrainian families, but for our community,” said Curtis Lee, Sasha’s sponsor and a member of “Carolinas for Ukraine.”A spokesperson for the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said there is “an administrative hold on all pending USCIS Benefit Requests filed by Parolees Under the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) Process.”“This is pending the completion of additional vetting to identify any fraud, public safety, or national security concerns,” they said in a statement to CNN. “USCIS is committed to safeguarding the integrity of our nation’s immigration system and carrying out President Trump and Secretary Noem’s mandate to make America safe again.”‘This community feels absolutely devastated’For Liana Avetisian and Alina Mirzoian, Ukrainian cousins who settled with their family in DeWitt, Iowa, that “administrative hold” could spell the end to their American dream. They paid thousands in application fees through the immigration system but have not yet received temporary protected status (TPS) and the administration suspended processing humanitarian parole extensions before theirs were granted, their sponsor Angela Boelens explained. The lack of action threatens to leave them in limbo.Avetisian said she feels betrayed. Boelens, who is also the president of Iowa Newcomer Community & Exchange (IA NICE), said the community feels betrayed too.“This community feels absolutely devastated. We don’t know what we’re going to do with all the home mortgages here in town, the people who are losing their valuable employees, their friends in school are crying. They had to hire a counselor at the school locally to help the children understand some of what’s going on,” she told CNN. Boelens explained that the community “had raised half a million dollars to buy transitional houses” for newcomers to stay in. Some have since been able to buy houses of their own.“This entire community feels really hurt, and this is a very, very red community, they’re in disbelief,” she said. “So, they’ll never step up again and help people like they did, because they also feel like they’ve been betrayed.”Sam Heer, who employs four Ukrainian workers including Avetisian and Mirzoian, told CNN “it would hurt” if they had to leave.Heer said the community is committed to helping them with their bills. He applied for work visas for the four of them, but he doesn’t “have a good feel” for the status of those permits, he said.“They’re great assets to our community, they’re hard working. They want to learn. They want to provide for their families,” he said.‘It’s going to tear us apart’The town of Hartsville is also bracing for the potential impact if their Ukrainian neighbors cannot stay.“They have become such an integral part of our community,” Lee told CNN, noting at least one company that relies on skilled labor from resettled Ukrainians. “People just embraced it. And it’s going to tear us apart if that happens.”Lee warned that the US government “doing nothing will actually force many of them to leave.”“They should at least give them some certainty,” he said, “even if they just kicked the can down the road and gave them all a blanket parole and work authorization until after the midterms.”Lee, who said he is a registered Republican, believes the U4U program aligns with the Trump administration’s priorities. Because of the sponsorship aspect, it has a relatively low cost for the US government. Boelens described the program as “the right kind of refugee program, handled perfectly.”“The US is not on the hook for tickets,” Lee noted. “We are basically taking on the burden of resettlement,” he noted.“Little towns like mine, we need to have people coming in, just from a pure population standpoint, and especially ones that are going to bring additional talent and diversity,” he said.The Ukrainians who came to the US through U4U “followed the legal process.”“They went through the background checks. They’ve done everything that they’re supposed to do. They follow the laws. They’re paying their taxes,” Lee said. “For all this talk of, well, you know, we’re going to get rid of the immigrants that supposedly aren’t good for the US – that’s not this group.”Uncertainty and fearFor the Ukrainians who may be affected, the specter of uprooting their lives again has already been traumatizing.“I feel really bad about the situation,” said Mirzoian, telling CNN she feels “nervous all the time.”Avetisian who came with her husband as well as her now 14-year-old daughter, and Mirzoian came to DeWitt in May 2023 from near Kyiv. They had returned to Ukraine after relocating for two months to Bulgaria at the start of Russia’s war, but then in autumn 2022 found that life there was “harder and more dangerous” amid Moscow’s relentless attacks on critical infrastructure.“No light, electricity, and it was cold, and we were sitting in our houses with candles,” she explained.When they came to DeWitt, they were welcomed into the community, where a couple of other Ukrainian families had also settled.“People here are all so good. They really helped us,” Avetisian told CNN. Now, if they are made to leave, they don’t feel that they can return to Ukraine.Liana Avetisian and her daughter in front of a transitional house in 2023.Courtesy Angela Boelens“I don’t want to take my 14-year-old daughter and go to another country and start there and learn a new language and make new friends and look for a new house. It’s very hard,” she said.Sasha said he feels like he’s back in the “worst period” of his life during the war, where he felt like he was not in control of his life.His family fled Kyiv with just minutes to pack their suitcases after explosions near their home and separated for several months – his wife and daughter went to Italy while he remained helping build shelters in Ukraine. He heard about the U4U program through a friend, and the family quickly made the decision to apply so they could be together.They were “a little bit confused and scared because we don’t know where we’re going, we didn’t know what to expect,” said Sasha.Speaking over video chat with Lee and his wife, Barbara, who were their sponsors, helped assuage some of those fears, he said. Their concerns were further eased when they arrived.Now, Sasha has restarted his construction business in Hartsville, building affordable tiny houses out of shipping containers.“He’s invested a lot, not just in time and effort, but he has a rental contract for the place he’s using to build stuff, he’s purchased a lot of equipment,” Lee explained.“I’m trying to not think about” possibly having to leave the US, Sasha said. He recalled that his daughter had just begun to talk when they relocated to the US after having to move several times.“She had the same question all the time, ‘Daddy, where is our home?’ When you can’t answer this question, I can’t even explain how it feels,” he told CNN. “A couple months ago, she started to call this place where we live in, she started to call it home.”",

      "content": "CNN—Clarksdale, Mississippi – which serves as inspiration for the setting of the Michael B. Jordan-starring film “Sinners” – does not have a local cineplex, which led community organizer Tyler Yarbrough toask the filmmakers and studiobehind the project to host a screening in the city.Yarbrough, along with Clarksdale mayor Chuck Espy, spoke to CNN’s Victor Blackwell for the“Art is Life”segment on Saturday, and shared their hopes that the screening will become a reality.“Clarksdale is a ways away from a movie theater,” Yarbrough said in an interview, later adding that it took him about an hour and a half to drive to a theater that was showing the film.Espy pointed to depopulation and lack of funds as contributing factors to the loss of Clarkdale’s two movie theaters, also detailing that most community-and family-centered venues started gravitating toward Memphis, Tennessee, some 80 miles away.“I’m really excited for the opportunity to have potentially cast members to come and to give people an opportunity to have a real feeling and a real dialogue, so they can immerse themselves in something that the country has not seen,” he shared, referencing the heritage of his city.“A lot of people are at the table to try to bring this to fruition,” he also said. “People from over a 2-hour radius are talking about coming to Clarksdale to see this event.”Neither Espy nor Yarbrough said any plans for the screening have been finalized, but Yarbrough mentioned “several conversations” he has been a part of with “Warner Bros. executives.” He said the screening is “looking very promising” to happen sometime between now and Juneteenth, but no details have been confirmed.“We are asking Michael B. Jordan the rest of the cast. We’re talking about studio execs,” Espy said. “Every single person that has touched this wonderful film launched a great release. We’re asking them to come to Clarksdale.”CNN has reached out to Warner Bros. Pictures for comment about the potential screening.“Sinners,” a period piece/crime thriller/vampire horror hybrid from “Black Panther” directorRyan Coogler, hasdominated the box officeand garnered positive reviews. The film is produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.In it, 1930s Mississippi is seen as a burgeoning and fertile place where blues music is created, as characters perform in moving cars and ajuke jointis thrown together for the community to enjoy.(L-r) Jayme Lawson, Wunmi Mosaku, Michael B. Jordan, Miles Caton and Li Jun Li in “Sinners.”Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures“Clarksdale is a melting pot. It has so many people that come from New Zealand, Australia, all around the world for the authentic feel of the blues,” Espy shared, later adding that the city’s legacy “has been going on for over a hundred years about the heritage of the Mississippi delta and the rich legacy of the blues.”“So people come from all around the world just to touch the sacred soil of this city, to say ‘I was there, where the blues was born.’”Yarbrough also mentioned how in a perfect world, he would be able to convince the “Sinners” production team and cast to not only come for a screening and conversation, but also to explore some of what contemporary Clarksdale has to offer.“We also wanted the cast to come down and experience our juke joints, to experience our museums like the Blues Museum,” among other things, he said.“I really love a part of the movie that Coogler captured very well was just showing how the blues is the foundation. And you saw one scene where he intertwined all the different genres, from from hip-hop to pop to rock into this one scene, and there’s a lot of power in that that locals need to see,” Yarbrough said. “And so I think when it comes to this screening and everything, too, we’re really trying to connect local folks, Deltans, to that power. So we can remember that we’re powerful.”CNN’s Hyan de Freitas contributed to this story.",

And the closure of a runway for construction.The result:Thousands of delays and flight cancellationsover the last two weeks at Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the nation’s busiest airports. It’s a perfect storm, with one air traffic controller describing the loss of communications alone as “the most dangerous situation you could have.”And with summer travel season approaching, the crisis at the New Jersey airport could mean weeks, if not months, of misery for travelers.Related articleNEWARK, NEW JERSEY - MAY 6:  Planes are parked at Terminal C in Newark Liberty International Airport, on May 6, 2025 in Newark, New Jersey. Passengers traveling to, from, or through Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) have experienced several days of delays and cancellations caused by air traffic control staffing shortages and equipment malfunctions.(Photo by Andres Kudacki/Getty Images)Andres Kudacki/Getty ImagesInternal FAA report downplayed risks of data outage affecting Newark air traffic controllers“It will be a dreadful summer, particularly around the high-volume holidays of the Fourth of July and Labor Day,” said Peter Goelz, a CNN aviation analyst and former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board.Whilethe air traffic controllers who went on leavecould be back on the job next month, the technology that failed them last week cannot be fixed or replaced quickly, meaning there’s a chance it will keep failing. Indeed,it happened again on Friday,with air traffic controllers handling flights approaching and departing Newark losing radar for about 90 seconds overnight, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.When will Newark – considered a microcosm of the problems plaguing America’s aviation system – get back to some semblance of normalcy? Not anytime soon, according to experts.“It just can’t be done quickly,” said Colin Scoggins, a former FAA military specialist and retired air traffic controller, referring to upgrades to the air traffic system and the hiring of new controllers.Video Ad FeedbackRetired air traffic controller says upgrading technology behind Newark airport failures \"can't be done quickly\"5:49- Source:CNNRetired air traffic controller says upgrading technology behind Newark airport failures \"can't be done quickly\"5:49On Thursday, theUS Department of Transportation announced a three-year-planto build a “brand-new air traffic control system” by 2028. The plan will replace “core” infrastructure, including radar, software, hardware and telecommunications networks, as well as the copper wiring that failed, impacting flights at Newark, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.“What you saw in Newark, you will see variations of that through the airspace in the coming years, unless we undertake this mission,” Duffy told CNN after making the announcement.On April 28, communications crashed at a Philadelphia air traffic control facility. The center handles aircraft in and out of Newark – roughly 85 miles north. A controller, who asked not to be identified, said he returned from a break to find co-workers recovering from an outage that lasted from 60 to 90 seconds. They could not see planes on radar scopes or communicate with pilots.The crash knocked out information from radars located at an FAA facility in Westbury, New York, where the air traffic controllers formerly managed flights heading to Newark. Airspace control was transferred to the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Control Facility (TRACON) last July and, since the move, the radars have been operated with what one source called a remote extension cord-like line.A single data feed connecting the two facilities failed, according to the controller, who said the feed had crashed at least two times before. More than a thousand flights were canceled as a precaution. And the incident, though brief, highlighted the flaws of an antiquated air traffic control system long afflicted by staffing shortages.Controllers ‘can’t take anymore’Five FAA employees – a supervisor, three controllers and one trainee – ended up taking 45 days of trauma leave after the outage, according to the air traffic controller.CNN aviation and transportation analyst Mary Schiavo, a former Department of Transportation inspector general, said controllers who “don’t feel they are well enough to come back and a doctor agrees” can apply to the Department of Labor to extend their leave.United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said the controllers on leave represented 20% of the air traffic control staff at the radar facility responsible for Newark. He said the control facility has been “chronically understaffed for years.”About 15 to 20 flights were being controlled by Newark Liberty approach controllers when communication and radar went down on April 28, according to an analysis by flight tracking site Flightradar24.The FAA on Wednesday said it will increase air traffic controller staffing but did not provide a specific number.United Airlines planes are seen Wednesday at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark. United's CEO Scott Kirby says he wants the federal government to limit the number of flights any airline could schedule to take off or land at the airport.Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty ImagesThe area in the Philadelphia TRACON responsible for Newark traffic has 22 certified controllers and 21 controllers and supervisors in training, with 10 of the latter receiving on-the-job training, the FAA said in a statement.The US needs more than 3,000 new air traffic controllers to reach adequate levels, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a union representing 10,800 professional controllers.Nationwidestaffingis at its lowest point innearly 30 years, Nick Daniels, president of the controllers union, testified before Congress in March.Themost recent FAA datashows that across all airport towers andterminal approach facilitiesnationwide, only about 70% of staffing targets were filled by fully certified controllers as of September 2023. When controllers in training are included, that rose to about 79%.Related articleThe FAA Air Traffic Control tower at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, in March 2024.Angus Mordant/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWhat we know about the massive staffing shortage that has caused 7 days of major delays at Newark AirportDespitevarious initiativesfor new hiring and increasing the starting salary for academy trainees by 30%,hiring and retaining controllers has been tough.Strict certification requirements coupled with burnout from long hours and job stress have contributed to the shortage.Training a new controller can take up to seven years. Approximately 40% to 50% of applicants do not successfully finish the demanding courses at the FAA academy, according to experts.“Air traffic controllers can’t take anymore. They’ve been working 60-hour weeks for years and years – six days a week,” CNN analyst and former FAA safety inspector David Soucie said.Reaching adequate air traffic controller staffing levels could take years, according to Scoggins.Newark exposes ‘vulnerability’The April 28 outage resulted in two weeks of chaos for passengers and a public outcry among government and airline officials. The breakdown was caused by failures in the copper wiring that transmits information from Long Island to Philadelphia, a source told CNN.“What we use today is copper wires. We are one of the last institutions, last businesses, that actually use copper wires,” Duffy told reporters Thursday.“We should be using fiber, but it’s copper. We use radar from the 1970s, some of them are from the 80s… So this technology is 50 years old that our controller has used to scan the skies and keep airplanes separated from one another.”Some controllers still use floppy disks to upload data onto computers that date to the early 1990s, according to experts.The FAA said ina statementWednesday it plans to add three new “high-bandwidth telecommunications connections” from New York to Philadelphia, replace copper lines with fiber-optic technology, and deploy a backup system to provide more speed and reliability.US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reveals plan for new air traffic control system Thursday at the Department of Transportation in Washington, DC.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesIn the longer term, Duffy announced a day later the complete,three-year reconstructionof the nation’s air traffic control system he said will be more reliable than the current antiquated technology.The plan will involve critical upgrades of communications, surveillance, automation and facilities. By 2028, more than 4,600 sites will get new high-speed network connections replacing antiqued telecommunications lines with fiber, wireless and satellite links, the department said.“But we are going to focus on Newark first,” Duffy told CNN  before Thursday’s announcement of the three-year plan.The chaos at Newark was compounded by the closure of its busiest runway for“rehabilitation work” that is not expected to be completed until mid-June.Another big contributing factor was the decision to move Newark’s approach controllers to Philadelphia last summer.Related articleNEWARK, NEW JERSEY - MAY 6:  Planes are parked at Terminal C in Newark Liberty International Airport, on May 6, 2025 in Newark, New Jersey.

The FAA at the timesaidthe move would help address the staffing problems and growing air traffic congestion.Within weeks, at least a half-dozen controllers reported what they described as serious safety issues caused by failures to collaborate between the two locations, CNN has reported.Before the move to Philadelphia,FAA experts downplayed safety concerns, concluding the odds of a dangerous communications breakdown were extremely unlikely: 1 in 11 million, according to an internal report obtained by CNN.Controllers in Philadelphia still rely on radar on Long Island that transmits data to Philadelphia via telecommunications lines. Two air traffic controllers told CNN the feedhad failed at least twice after the move.Kirby said United has asked the federal government to putlevel three slot controlsin place at Newark as a short-term fix – limiting the number of flights any airline could schedule to take off or land at the airport.“If they throttle back the scheduling of the flights then it’s going to be a half decent summer but there’s not going to be any flights available to get people where they want to go though,” Soucie, the CNN safety analyst, said.“The reason we’re focusing on Newark right now is because it was the perfect storm – the equipment failures, the lack of personnel, the fact that they had just moved quite a few controllers over to the Philadelphia center,” he added.“And the fact that it had all these things happen all at once, at one time, shows the vulnerability of all of the air traffic control centers.”CNN’s Aaron Cooper, Blake Ellis, Casey Tolan, Kyung Lah, Melanie Hicken, Rene Marsh, Amanda Musa, Chris Boyette and Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report.",

He wrote a famous open letter to all Catholics in 1891, called “Rerum Novarum” (“Of Revolutionary Change”), which reflected on the destruction wrought by the Industrial Revolution on the lives of workers.“In our own day, the church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice and labor,” the new American pontiff said Saturday, speaking in fluent Italian.Wearing the white robes of the papacy, he strongly signaled to the cardinals that his leadership will build upon Pope Francis’ church reforms and legacy of social justice.“It has been clearly seen in the example of so many of my predecessors, and most recently by Pope Francis himself, with his example of complete dedication to service and to sober simplicity of life, his abandonment to God throughout his ministry and his serene trust at the moment of his return to the Father’s house,” Pope Leo told the gathering. “Let us take up this precious legacy and continue on the journey, inspired by the same hope that is born of faith.”Pope Leo XIV met with cardinals in the Vatican's synod hall – a deviation from the typical location for the first meeting with cardinals, which is usually held in the apostolic palace.Vatican MediaHe went on to ask the other senior church leaders to renew their commitment to the pivotalSecond Vatican Council, which enacted sweeping church reforms in the 1960s. The modernizing reforms included allowing Mass to be celebrated in local languages rather than Latin for the first time.Setting out that vision on Saturday, Leo said the church should be guided by a missionary focus, “growth in collegiality and synodality,” courageous dialogue with the contemporary world and “loving care for the least and the rejected.”Pope Leo XIV conducts Mass in the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, May 9, 2025.

This has proved a great comfort to me in accepting a yoke clearly far beyond my own limited powers, as it would be for any of us,” Leo added.“Your presence reminds me that the Lord, who has entrusted me with this mission, will not leave me alone in bearing its responsibility,” he said, also specifically thanking Dean of the College of Cardinals Giovanni Battista Re and the Camerlengo Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, who was responsible for shepherding the church through the papal transition.“He is an excellent pope and he had much more than 100 votes,” Cardinal Désiré Tsarahazana of Madagascar told Italian news outlet RAI on Saturday. “This morning’s meeting went very well, we also spoke about the need to make the church more collegial.”After the meeting with cardinals, Leo left the Vatican to visit an Augustinian sanctuary just outside Rome, the Madonna del Buon Consiglio (Mother of Good Counsel), in Genazzano, according to the Vatican press office. The pope, who is also the first pontiff from the Augustinian religious order, was greeted by the local bishop and several hundred people in the town square.The visit to the Augustinian church holds huge significance for the new pontiff, who was formerly global leader of the religious order. The sanctuary is also linked to his namesake, Leo XIII, who had a strong devotion to Mary as “Our Lady of Good Counsel.”“I wanted so much to come here in these first days of the new Ministry that the Church has given me, to carry forward this mission as the Successor of Peter,” the pope told those gathered outside the church after he prayed in front of the altar and the image of Mary.Pope Leo will appear on the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica for a second time on Sunday to greet crowds of people in the square below.

      "content": "CNN—Mother’s Day is busy season for American florists. But this year, there’s an added source of stress: President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, which are raising the prices of some flowers and causing some wary shoppers to pull back on spending.“We have to charge more, and it’s definitely affecting sales — which I totally get,” Allison Krivachek of Hydrangea Bloom in Tiffin, Iowa, told CNN. “People just don’t have the disposable income they used to.”Eighty percent of all cut flowers sold in the United States are imported from Colombia, Canada or Ecuador, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The majority of those flowers come from Colombia and Ecuador, where year-round growing climates support the floral industry. Those countries now face tariffs making it more expensive for their products to enter the United States.And Mother’s Day spending has dropped 14% among US shoppers as many are scaling back due to tariffs and economic concerns, according to aLendingTree survey.America imported approximately $2.26 billion worth of fresh-cut flowers in 2024, with Colombia accounting for 60% of the market and Ecuador following with 25%,according to US Census Bureau data.Debra Prinzing, founder of the Slow Flowers Society and a leading advocate for American-grown flowers, said the US floral industry was built to rely on imports.“Don’t like it, but that’s just the reality,” Prinzing told CNN.“Ridiculously different,” is how Krivachek describes this year’s price hike. Flowers such as lisianthus have doubled in price, Krivachek said, and roses are up anywhere from 10% to 50% compared to last year. She believes the price hikes are higher than what would be reflected in a 10% tariff.“It’s just really weird that there’s been such a jump because the tariffs aren’t that much. And I don’t know if they’re raising their prices because of supply and demand,” she said.As a result, she’s raised the price of her most popular Mother’s Day arrangement from $100 to $125 this year. And despite efforts to be transparent with customers, demand has taken a hit.“We’re down quite a bit,” Krivachek said. “We’re down about 30% year-over-year on this Mother’s Day compared to other Mother’s Days.”Many customers are now buying flowers to craft their own arrangements, according to Krivachek.The Society of American Florists told CNN florists and wholesalers across the country are adapting to the new financial pressures — much like they did during the pandemic and other supply chain disruptions.“While tariffs and cost increases are not welcome developments, the floral industry is remarkably resilient,” the society told CNN in a statement.Florists are ordering products earlier, strengthening relationships with growers and wholesalers and planning further in advance to manage costs, the society said.While Krivachek has felt the pressure, she’s found ways to adjust, such as by sourcing from local flower farmers.“I’m still going to have to import flowers,” she said. “I’m in Iowa, so there’s not a lot of variety, especially with weddings. There’s certain flowers that only you can get from Ecuador and Colombia.”",

      "content": "CNN—After months of contending with the Trump administration’s multi-pronged effort to downsize the federal workforce, government employees are now facing the possibility ofanother major change that could push even more of them out the door.House Republicans are looking to make several big adjustments to federal workers’ retirement benefits to help pay for the party’s sweeping tax and spending cuts package. The House Oversight Committee last week approved a plan that would squeeze $50 billion in savings out of the retirement system over the next decade.“They’re going to charge people more for the benefit, and then they’re going to reduce the benefit by changing the formula for how the benefit is calculated,” Jacqueline Simon, policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers union, told reporters on Monday.The cuts could lead workers eligible for retirement to head for the exits in an effort to lock in their current benefits, union leaders say.Democratic Lawmakers address hundreds at the \"Nobody Elected Elon\" rally outside of the Department of The Treasury building on February ?4, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Elected Democratic members of Congress were denied entry into the building earlier in the day after Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gained access to the Treasury Department's payment systems.Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/ShutterstockRelated articleFederal workers, CNN wants to hear from youCongressional Republicans have long wanted to overhaul federal staffers’ pension system, as didPresident Donald Trumpduring his first term. But their efforts typically did not advance far.In the current political environment, however, the policy push may have a greater chance of succeeding.Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” has not yet been finalized and must still be approved by the full House and the Senate.Rep. James Comer, the committee’s chair, described the effort as a way to save Americans money.“The simple truth is that a significant amount of the costs associated with all of these benefits are funded by hardworking taxpayers in the private sector and increasingly now federal government borrowing,” Comer said in his opening remarks when the committee examined the plan.At least one House Republican has already come out against the measure. Ohio Rep. Mike Turner joined Democrats in voting against the committee’s plan last week.“I oppose any and all efforts to reduce federal spending by taking money from the hard-earned pensions of federal workers,” he said in a statement. “These pensions are not giveaways – they are promises to federal workers in exchange for their dedicated service.”Hiking the contribution rateThe most significant measure approved by the committeewould raise the Federal Employees Retirement System contribution rate for many current civilian and postal employees to 4.4% of their salary. Those hired prior to 2014 generally contribute either 0.8% or 3.1%, while more recent hires typically already contribute 4.4%.For new retirees who are too young to collect Social Security benefits, the plan would eliminate an additional payment that’s currently available to retired federal workers until they turn 62.The plan would also base retirees’ pension payments on their average highest five earning years, instead of highest three years, which could reduce benefits by thousands of dollars annually.Certain employees, including those in law enforcement, Customs and Border Protection officers and air traffic controllers, would not be subject to these provisions, though they would not be eligible for the additional pension payment until after their mandatory retirement age of 56 or 57, depending on their position.Plus, the plan would impose an additional 5% pension contribution for new employees who don’t agree to serve “at will,” a status that would give them fewer job protections.The proposed plan has sparked a fresh round of concerns among federal workers, particularly among older employees, union leaders say.“People are very frustrated at the moment, thinking that it’s kind of like a bait and switch,” said Brandy Moore White, president of the AFGE’s Council of Prison Locals, which represents more than 30,000 correctional officers and staff at federal prisons.Although her members are not subject to many of the provisions, those who retire before they turn 57 would not receive supplemental payments until they hit that mandatory retirement age. The loss would be “devastating” for a share of the prison workforce since it’s not uncommon for employees to retire in their 40s or early 50s after years of service.At the Social Security Administration, a quarter of the staff are eligible for retirement, said Jessica LaPointe, president of AFGE’s Council 220, which represents workers in the agency’s centers, field offices and other units. Some are calling her to say they want to put in their retirement papers now so they can lock in their pension benefits.“There’s no way that I would be able to absorb that hit,” she said her colleagues are telling her.",

Despite fans predicting that “the Joker” would deliver one of his extraordinary performances after arriving in such a manner, Oklahoma effectively stifled Jokić, who missed 17 of his 25 shots, including all 10 of his three-pointers, and had eight turnovers.Still, he finished with 20 points, 16 rebounds and six assists – a respectable return for almost any other player who doesn’t have his own lofty standards.“I mean, 20, 16 and six, just an awful NBA night,” joked Nuggets coach David Adelman.The Nuggets’ offense was happy to share the points around, downing the Thunder behind Jamal Murray’s 27, Aaron Gordon’s 22 and Michael Porter Jr.’s 21.Nikola Jokić shoots the ball over MVP rival Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.Ron Chenoy/Imagn Images/ReutersBoth teams were tied at 102 at the end of regulation time with Jokić missing a buzzer-beater for the Nuggets after fellow MVP frontrunner Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had also missed a chance to win for the Thunder a few seconds earlier.Like Jokić, Gilgeous-Alexander was kept quiet, adding 18 points on 7-of-22 shooting, as well as10 rebounds and four assists. Jalen Williams led the way for the Thunder with a playoff career-high 32 points.The Thunder has a chance to level the series on Sunday when the two teams next take to the court.Cavs fight back to make it 2-1Elsewhere, the Cleveland Cavaliers dug deep to hold off an Indiana Pacers comeback, secure a 126-104 win on Friday and drag themselves back into the playoff series.With key players Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and De’Andre Hunter returning from the injuries which forced them out of Game 2, the Cavs more closely resembled the team that earned the top seed in the Eastern Conference. They are now 2-1 down and will attempt to level the series in Game 4 on Sunday.Donovan Mitchell led the scoring with 43 points, the second consecutive game he has posted more than 40 points.Having so many players back from injury was a “huge boost,” Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson told reporters afterward. “We weren’t sure until 35 on the clock that they were going to play. We’re a different team right?”The Cleveland Cavaliers now have a chance to level the series.Justin Casterline/Getty ImagesCleveland enjoyed a comfortable lead for much of the game, which even ballooned to 24 points early in the third quarter. The Pacers launched a mini comeback and cut that to 11 points in the fourth but, with the specter of a 3-0 deficit looming, the Cavs rallied to ultimately take a comfortable win.CNN’s Kevin Dotson contributed reporting.",

      "title": "THC drinks are flying off shelves. Can it last? | CNN Business",

      "published_at": "2025-05-10 11:46",
      "content": "New YorkCNN—In June 2023,Jon Halper started selling THC beverages at Top Ten Liquors, his chain of Minnesota stores. The drinks, which contain the main intoxicating chemical compound found in cannabis, were a massive hit.“Immediately, the sales took off,” said Halper. “We’ve never seen anything explosive like this.”After just two years, THC beverages make up about 15% of overall sales, he said. “It’s hard to believe this growth isn’t going to be astronomical.”The time is right for a THC beverage boom. Many Americans areembracing a California sober lifestyle— drinking less alcohol, which theysee as harmful to health, andtrying outmarijuana instead. Astudypublished in 2024 found that a higher number of Americans reported using cannabis every day than drinking alcohol daily.And thanks to what many consider to be a loophole in the 2018 farm bill, THC beverage makers have been able to rapidly launch their products across the country with little oversight. Now, states are trying to make sense of the bill’s language, setting up their own regulations and raising questions for the future of the fast-growing industry.A category that came out of nowhereFor years, beverage companies toyed with the idea of using THC in drinks. But cannabis is a tricky business. Marijuana is a “schedule I controlled substance” in the United States, meaning companies that sell marijuana products legally don’t get certain tax benefits. The classification also makes it hard for those firms to get funding from financial institutions wary of breaking federal laws.So drink makers avoided cannabis. Then the2018 farm billchanged the game.Thelengthy documentgoverns a wide range of agricultural and food assistance programs, and it includes a few pages thatlegalized the production of hemp, defined as a cannabis plant that has no more than 0.3% delta-9 THC on a dry-weight basis (cannabis plants with higher concentrations of THC are classified as marijuana). That language spawned a fast-growing market of technically legal THC beverages that are still potent enough to make you feel something.At the time, “these drinks did not exist,” said Frank Colombo, managing director of Viridian Capital Advisors, which specializes in cannabis. “Nobody anticipated this whole category of hemp-based intoxicants, let alone hemp-based THC drinks.”THC drinks, like the ones seen on shelves at Total Wine & More, have become popular in recent years.Ray Stern/The Republic/USA Today Network/Imagn ImagesIn 2020, the US market for hemp-derived THC drinks amounted to about $400,000, according to Brightfield Group, a consumer insights and market research firm that has been tracking the THC drink industry. By 2024, the market had grown nearly 10 times bigger, reaching $382 million dollars. This year, it will grow to $571 million, Brightfield predicts, with more expansion to come.THC beverage makers have been exempt from the onerous regulations that apply to marijuana companies. But some entrepreneurs seek a Goldilocks zone for regulation: Too little could allow bad actors — those who market to children or sell high-dosage products made with synthetic ingredients — to proliferate, encouraging bans. Too much would constrain growth. But the right amount would legitimize their businesses, putting them on a path to skyrocketing growth.Companies are betting that things will go their way. Experts are not so sure.“I do not think it’s going to go perfectly,” said Hilary Bricken, an attorney with Husch Blackwell who focuses on the hemp and cannabis industries. She can “appreciate the confidence” of young companies trying to forge a path, but “it’s still going to be a bumpy road.”From dispensaries to liquor storesWhen Cann first launched in 2019, the THC beverage was only available at a handful of cannabisdispensaries.“At the time, we thought that was the only place you could sell these products,” explained Jake Bullock, co-founder and CEO of Cann. The drink had initially derived its THC and CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid present in Cann drinks, from marijuana. Then in 2022, a newMinnesota lawhelped clarify the farm bill’s language,explicitly allowingcertain hemp-derived THC products to be sold to customers aged 21 or older.“We were like, ‘Well, wait, can we extract THC and CBD from hemp?’”Bullock recounted.They could, and it took just 60 days. Cann launched the updated product in Minnesota in October of that year.Today, Cann is sold in stores across 30 states and available direct-to-customer in at least 35 states.In 2024, revenue grew over 70%, according to the company. It expects over 100% growth this year.Cann THC drinksCourtesy CannCann and other THC drink brands describe their products as social tonics, designed to give a light, mellow buzz that, they say, will help you feel good at parties but not hungover the next day. Cann’s drinks come in flavors like blood orange cardamom and yuzu elderflower and have no more than 10 milligrams of THC per can.“If you think about alcohol and caffeine, we drink these in microdoses,” Bullock said. “There’s a reason you can have a few cups of coffee or a couple of glasses of wine. We wanted to capture that same kind of concept.”The competition heats upEven shoppers who aren’t familiar with THC drinks are in the market for a new kind of beverage: Stroll down a refrigerator aisle and you’ll seeprebiotic sodasin countless flavors, botanical teas, canned lattes with a variety of milks, sparkling everythings,non-alcoholic beersand more.And over the past few years, Cann has been joined by scores of competitors.For example, hi Seltzer, a calorie-free drink that comes in fruit flavors and contains five milligrams of THC, launched in 2023. “We’re running somewhere between 1.2 (million) and 1.5 million cans a month,” CEO Louis Police said in April, “which doesn’t even satisfy the demand.”hi Seltzer comes in fruit flavors and five milligrams of THC.Courtesy hi SeltzerBRĒZ, a THC beverage brand that use lion’s mane mushroom extract, has seen sales explode since it started in 2023. In 2024, the company recorded about $28 million in revenue, saidfounder and CEOAaron Nosbisch. This year, it’s on track to hit about $75 million.The market has also attracted alcohol makers like Samantha Lee, co-founder of Hopewell Brewing Company in Chicago, Illinois. Last year, she and her Hopewell co-founders (plus one more) launched Choom, a sparkling canned THC beverage that comes in mostly citrus flavors.“We’re seeing a lot of our current customer base who are really excited about (Choom),” she said.Lee is optimistic thatIllinois will regulatethe market in a way that well help business thrive.“We’re seeing a lot of positive movements in Illinois that will codify this as a law,” she said. But until that happens, major retailers may avoid selling brands like Choom. Without clear regulation, “there’s only so much we can do.”A patchwork systemThe Hemp Beverage Alliance (HBA), a trade group formed two years ago, shares its own regulatory principles on labeling, dosing, age restrictions and more on its website.Brands are also educating distributors, retailers and consumers about their THC drinks. But self-regulation can only go so far.“It’s going to be challenging for someone to truly break out… until there is something at the federal level that is a clear indication that these products can be scaled and will be legal,” said Duane Stanford, executive editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade publication.Ideally, there would be “a federal framework that guides the entire country” said Christopher Lackner, president of the HBA.But that’s a moonshot, at least in the near term. For now, the alliance, which represents over 250 brands, retailers and distributors across North America, is working toward getting industry-friendly regulation at the state level.Half of US states permit hemp-derived delta-9 THC beverages as of May 1, according to the HBA. The rest either severely limit THC content in these drinks, prohibit their sale outright or have not regulated the product, by the HBA’s count.An uncertain futureAs states decide how to move forward, the federal government could crack down or make hemp illegal again.“If the FDA starts getting increased accounts of, let’s say, kids getting ahold of this stuff, or consumers being misled (or) having adverse reactions,” it might set its own restrictions, said Bricken, the Husch Blackwell attorney.Then there’s the question of the farm bill.The current legislation has beenextended through later this year. But if the administration decides to make hemp illegal in the next farm bill,it would have a chilling effect on the THC beverage industry, said Whitt Steineker, partner at Bradley and co-chair of the law firm’s cannabis industry team.“You would see the money flow really dry up,” he said.Halper, of Top Ten Liquors, isn’t quite sure what to expect from the federal government.“We all talk about the next farm bill,” he said, adding: “None of us control what is happening in Washington.”",

Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!” Trump posted on Truth Social.It was the first comment from Trump after a day of talks in Geneva between US officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese officials. A source briefed on the meetings told CNN talks will continue Sunday.Bessent urged the public earlier this week not to expect a major trade deal out of the meetings, but he acknowledged it was an important step in negotiations.A cargo ship moors at the container terminal berth of Lianyungang Port for loading and unloading containers in Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province, China, on May 9, 2025.Costfoto/NurPhoto/Getty ImagesRelated articleZero ships from China are bound for California’s top ports. Officials haven’t seen that since the pandemicVice Premier He Lifeng is leading the talks on the Chinese side, state broadcaster CCTV said in abrief report.Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua called the Switzerland talks “an important step toward resolving the issue.”“However, an ultimate solution requires sufficient strategic patience and determination, as well as the just support of the international community,” Xinhua said.The US has placed a minimum 145% tariff on most Chinese imports, and China has responded with a 125% tariff on most US imports. As a result, trade between the two sides isfalling sharply, according to logistics experts.Even reducing that tariff rate by half might not be enough to change trade levels significantly. Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the two countries.On Friday, hours after Bessent and Greer had set off for Switzerland, Trump floated the possibility of slashing tariffs on Chinese goods to 80% while demanding China “open up its market to USA.”“80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B,” Trump said in aTruth Social post.The combination of fewer goods arriving in the US and increased costs on imports that do arrive has already started pushing up prices for Americans. Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday that a key measure of inflation would effectively double to 4% by the end of the year because of Trump’s trade war.Andwith ships carrying goods under the 145% tariffsnow coming into port, a trade deal wouldn’t lower prices immediately.To say Americans depend on a wide range of Chinese goods understates how pervasive they have become in daily life. Footwear, clothes, appliances, microchips, baby goods, toys, sports equipment, office machine parts and much more all pour into the US from China in staggering numbers.But now those imports are decreasing. Imports into the United States during the second half of 2025 are expected to fall at least 20% year over year, according to the National Retail Federation. The decline from China will be even starker. Investment bank JPMorgan expects a 75% to 80% drop in imports from there.Economic impactThe trade war has already affected the US economy. The nation’sgross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed America’s first quarterly contraction since early 2022, as importers raced to bring in goods before punishing tariff rates kicked in.The impact of the sky-high tariffs is also being felt keenly in China, whose exports to the US fell sharply in April. Chinese outbound shipments to the US stood at$33 billionlast month — a whopping 21% decline from the$41.8 billionrecorded in April 2024, according to a CNN calculation.Switzerland's President Karin Keller-Sutter, US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Switzerland's Economy Minister Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin, in Geneva, Switzerland.Martial Trezzini/APRelated articleInside Trump’s negotiating strategy with ChinaSteep US tariffs have also taken a heavy toll on China’s manufacturing sector.

The US and China are the world’s largest and second-largest economies, respectively, bigger than even the next 20 economies put together,according to World Bank data.Trump also told a conservative radio host on Wednesday that he wouldraise the caseof jailed Hong Kong media tycoonJimmy Lai“as part of the negotiation.” Lai, a pugnacious former publisher whose now-shuttered tabloid Apple Daily was a regular thorn in Beijing’s side, is in the midst of a national security trial that could send him to prison for life.CCTV did not say whether Lai featured in the talks.This story has been updated with additional developments.CNN’s Fred He, Nectar Gan, David Goldman and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.",

      "content": "Kyiv, UkraineCNN—The leaders of Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Poland have told Russian leader Vladimir Putin to agree to a30-day ceasefirestarting on Monday or face possible “massive” sanctions, according to French President Emmanuel Macron, on a highly symbolic visit to Kyiv. The demand comes with the backing of the White House after a joint phone call with President Donald Trump, the Europeans said.Standing alongside Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, the four leaders - Macron,new German ChancellorFriedrich Merz, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk – said the ceasefire should be observed on land, at sea and in the air.If successful, Macron said, it could pave the way for “the immediate launch of negotiations to build a robust and lasting peace.”In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen shortly after the leaders called for the ceasefire, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Russia is “resistant to any kind of pressure.”“Europe is actually confronting us very openly,” Peskov said, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin supports the idea of a ceasefire “in general,” but “there are lots of questions” about the recent proposal that still need answering. He did not expand on what these questions are.US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir PutinReuters/Getty ImagesRelated articleUS and other allies of Ukraine pile pressure on Putin, threatening fresh sanctions if he refuses 30-day truceThe dramatic announcement gives Putin less than 36 hours to respond, and also means a complex mechanism of satellite monitoring and communications would need to become operational in the same, short time period.“We have agreed that from Monday 12th of May, a full and unconditional ceasefire must start for at least 30 days,” Zelensky said. “We demand it together from Russia and we know that the United States supports us in this.“The unconditional ceasefire means no conditions and an attempt to put conditions on it is to signal an intention to drag out the war and undermine diplomacy.”The four European leaders arrived together by train early Saturday morning and were met at Kyiv’s main railway station by Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. Their first public engagement was at Independence Square, where they stood to honor Ukraine’s fallen soldiers. Then it was on to the city’s Mariinsky Palace, where they met together for more than three hours.The leaders of Ukraine, France, the United Kingdom and Germany pay their respects to victims of war at the Memorial for the Fallen in Kyiv on May 10, 2025.Ludovic Marin/Pool/AFP/Getty ImagesAfterwards, the leaders sat together round a phone and spoke to Trump. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha posted a photo of the moment on social media, saying the call had been “fruitful,” while Zelensky called it “positive and concrete.” There was no immediate response from the White House.For two months now, Ukraine has said it wants an immediate 30-day ceasefire – a position promoted by Kyiv’s key European allies, and also by Trump.Russia has so far refused to commit, saying it supports the idea of a 30-day ceasefire in principle but insists there are what it calls “nuances” that need addressing first.In aninterview with ABC Newspublished earlier on Saturday, Peskov suggested that one of these “nuances” was putting a halt to the supply of US and European weapons to Ukraine.Putin has often spoken about the need to address what he calls “root causes” – which are taken to mean, among others, the eastward expansion of NATO.In aTruth Socialpost on Thursday, Trump wrote that “if the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,” adding to a sense he is growing frustrated with Russian stalling.Peskov told CNN Saturday that Russia is “very grateful” for the US’ mediation efforts, but added that “at the same time, it’s quite useless to try to press on us.”Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stand in Independence Square in Kyiv.Stefan Rousseau/WPA Pool/Getty ImagesThe inauguration of Trump in January ushered in a complete change in the US diplomatic focus on the war, with Ukraine and key allies fearful of a significant tilt in US policy towards Moscow.European leaders have convened a series of meetings in response, aimed both at showing the US that Europe can do more to support Ukraine militarily, as well as providing a single voice urging the US president not to take Russia’s side in the war.Russia declared a unilateral ceasefire for 72 hours, scheduled around the anniversary of Victory Day. But just three minutes past midnight, soldiers in Ukraine’s National Guard told CNN’s Nick Paton Walsh they had already begun observing fresh artillery fire and other Russian attacks across the front-line. They also showed video of what they said was a massive build-up of Russian troops and armour.Clipped From VideovideoRelated videoThe Kremlin promised a 72 hour ceasefire. These Ukrainian soldiers say it never happenedFor its part, rather than commit to a lengthy ceasefire, the Kremlin has instead pursued a policy of unilateral short-term ceasefires - thelatest of whichbegan on Thursday and is due to end at midnight tonight.It coincided with Russia’s May 9Victory Day celebrations– when the country marks the defeat of Nazi Germany. This year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazilian leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva were among Putin’s guests attending the annual parade in Moscow.Ukraine has reported many hundreds of Russian attacks along frontline locations during the ceasefire period, though missile and Shahed drone attacks on Ukraine’s cities have not been seen since Wednesday.In a rare – though not unprecedented – move, the US embassy in Kyiv issued a security alert Friday warning it had intelligence suggesting a possible “significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days.”CNN’s Svitlana Vlasova, Daria Tarasova-Markina, Frederik Pleitgen and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report",

      "content": "CNN—On Friday morning, West Coast port officials told CNN about a startling sight: Not a single cargo vessel had left China with goods for the two major West Coast ports in the past 12 hours. That hasn’t happened since the pandemic.Six days ago, 41 vessels were scheduled to depart China for the San Pedro Bay Complex, which encompasses both the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach in California. On Friday, it was zero.President Donald Trump’s trade war imposed massive tariffs on most Chinese imports last month. That’s led to fewer ships at sea carrying less cargo to America’s ports. For many businesses, it is now too expensive to do business with China, one of America’s most important trading partners.Officials are concerned not just about the lack of vessels leaving China, but the speed at which that number dropped.“That’s cause for alarm,” said Mario Cordero, the CEO of the Port of Long Beach. “We are now seeing numbers in excess of what we witnessed in the pandemic” for cancellations and fewer vessel arrivals.The busiest ports in the country are experiencing steep declines in cargo. The Port of Long Beach is seeing a 35-40% drop compared to normal cargo volume. The Port of Los Angeles had a 31% drop in volume this week, and the Port of New York and Jersey says it’s also bracing for a slowdown. On Wednesday, the Port of Seattle said it had zero container ships in the port, another anomaly that hasn’t happened since the pandemic.“That’s because just nothing is being shipped over,” port commissioner Ryan Calkins told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.A container ship sits docked at the Port of Los Angeles on May 6, 2025, in San Pedro, California. Los Angeles and Long Beach ports are seeing significant drops in expected cargo ships coming into port this week due to tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesUS and Chinese trade representatives are set to meet in Geneva this weekend for their first face to face meeting in an attempt to deescalate the trade war. Most goods shipping from China to the United States have a 145% tariff, while most US exports to China are being hit with a 125% tariff. On Friday, President Donald Trump suggested lowering the tariff rate with China to 80%, but said the final terms would be up to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.For consumers, who are facing higher prices or shortages of certain items, Cordero says a deal can’t come soon enough.“If things don’t change quickly, I’m talking about the uncertainty that we’re seeing, then we may be seeing empty products on the shelves. This is now going to be felt by the consumer in the coming 30 days,” said Cordero.Upwards of 63% of the cargo that flows into the Port of Long Beach is from China — the largest share of any US port. But that number is down from 72% in 2016 as retailers shift away from China over simmering trade tensions.Even so, China still represents a major source of imports into the United States. Maersk, the second largest shipping line in the world, told CNN the cargo volume between the United States and China has fallen by 30-40%compared to normal.“If we don’t start to see a de-escalation of the situation with China, if we don’t start to see more of those trade deals, then we could be in a situation where some of these effects get more entrenched and are more adverse,” said Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc.–CNN’s Maisie Linford contributed to this reportThis story’s headline has been updated to better reflect the story’s reporting and timeline.",

      "content": "CNN—In the southern Philippine city of Davao, a spirited mayoral election campaign is in full swing, with candidates and their supporters out canvassing for votes.But one of the leading contenders is conspicuously absent from the stump. Instead he’s 7,000 miles away, languishing in the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Netherlands.Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is awaiting trial at The Hague forcrimes against humanity, over a brutal war on drug dealers that killed possibly thousands of people, including many innocents and bystanders, with barely any kind of due process.None of this affects the 80-year-old’s eligibility for the role of mayor of Davao – a job he held, on and off, for two decades. Under Philippine election law, only a criminal conviction in a local court can keep a candidate off the ballot.Duterte could well win Monday’s election, thanks to his enduring popularity in the region, where many credit his two-decade iron grip with tightening up law and order, before he took his brutal zero-tolerance policy nationwide as president from 2016 to 2022.“I grew up here all my life and when I was younger it was very dangerous, killings and fighting everywhere,” said Ian Baldoza, 46, a native of Davao who remains a loyal Duterte supporter.“But as I grew older, I started to understand that those who were killed were drug addicts, dealers and troublemakers.”He praised Duterte for improving public safety, building infrastructure and strengthening law enforcement in the city of 1.8 million people, telling CNN: “You never see people spit on the street or leave trash behind, unlike in other cities.”Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has not been on the campaign trail since his arrest by the International Criminal Court on March 11, 2025.Daniel Ceng/Anadolu/Getty ImagesMany Davao voters feel similarly, said Cleve Arguelles, a political scientist and head of polling firm WR Numero.“His ICC arrest doesn’t really shake their core of who Duterte is but rather, paradoxically, it only reinforces what Duterte stands for,” he said.Baldoza, the Duterte voter, said he witnessed neighbors killed by hitmen under Duterte’s drug war, yet his Facebook profile is full of pro-Duterte posts.“We’re not looking for a saint, we’re looking for a leader with political will, and the Duterte family has that, especially in the patriarch,” he said.While he has not commented publicly on the race, Duterte’s daughter Sara, the Philippine vice president, thanked supporters on her father’s behalf at a rally on Thursday.“President Rodrigo Duterte thanks you all for your love, your continued support, and your prayers that he will one day be brought back to our country,” she told a crowd in the capital Manila, under heavy rain.Thousands of local posts are up for grabs in the midterm elections across the archipelago nation of about 120 million people, ranging from district councilors and mayors all the way up to legislators.Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte gives a speech at the campaign rally of senatorial candidates under the party of her father and former president Rodrigo Duterte in Manila on May 8, 2025.Jam Sta Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesThree generations of the Duterte clan are fighting elections.

His old age and frail health also raise questions on the succession for the dynasty, which has not been as solid as it once was, said Ramon Beleno, a political analyst and former professor from Ateneo de Davao University, who has observed elections in the Duterte clan’s bailiwick for more than a decade.“The people of Davao have this perspective that a political dynasty is OK if it’s working,” Beleno said.“But it’s only working as long as the patriarch, the person who established the political dynasty, is still strong.”Opposition camps, in the elder Duterte’s absence from the country, are re-emerging across Davao, according to Beleno.Among them are descendants of the late former national House speaker Prospero Nograles, reigniting a decades-old family rivalry that typifies the nation’s clan-tinged politics.Karlo Nograles is running against Rodrigo Duterte for the mayoralty while his sister, Margarita, a lawyer and rising TikTok influencer, is challenging Paolo.Scandal-hit political dynastyAnd cracks in the Duterte family name are beginning to show.Vice President Sara Duterte is in along-running feudwith President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and faces calls for her impeachment for alleged corruption, which she denies.“In the past months my name and my family name has been dragged through the mud,” she said at the recent rally.A Catholic nun walks past portraits of victims of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs displayed during a mass for victims at a church in Manila on March 11, 2025.

The Dutertes are not the problem of the Philippines,” she said, in a vailed dig at the incumbent Marcos administration, the family’s allies turned enemies.Marcos Jr. hails from perhapsthe most famous political family in the nation- he is the son of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos.Paolo Duterte and his bodyguards were recently embroiled in a nightclub brawl, prompting a businessman to file a complaint against him. He said in avideo statementthat the clip of the melee circulating on social media was “taken a very long time ago.”If Duterte wins the mayoral election, he can still be sworn in by proxy or in absentia – possibly by a Zoom call, if the ICC allows it, according to political scientist and pollster Arguelles. His day-to-day duties would be delegated to the vice mayor.But if Rodrigo Duterte is not allowed to be sworn in virtually, the runner-up – projected to be Karlo Nograles – would ascend to the seat.Duterte ran the Philippines for six turbulent years, during which his brutal crackdown on drugs – which he openly boasted about – killed manyyoung menfrom impoverished shanty towns, shot by police and rogue gunmen.According to police data, 6,000 people were killed – but rights groups say the death toll could be as high as 30,000.Duterte’s tough approach on drugs prompted strong criticism from opposition lawmakers who launched a probe into the killings. Duterte in turnjailed his fiercest opponentand accused some news media and rights activists as traitors and conspirators.The ICC has set his next hearing for September 23.",

      "content": "CNN—A federal judge is halting the Trump administration from carrying out, under aFebruary executive order, mass firings or major reorganizations of multiple agencies going forward.Senior District Judge Susan Illston on Friday evening granted atemporary restraining ordersought by federal employee unions, local governments and outside organizations that rely on federal services, who argued the administration was acting outside the bounds of the law. The judge’s order, which lasts two weeks, blocks the administration’s approval or implementation of plans –- known as Agency RIF and Reorganization Plans, or ARRPs – for conducting mass layoffs and for shrinking or eliminating entire components of an agency. She is also pausing any orders from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, cutting programs or staff in accordance with Trump’s executive order and the related directives.A worker wheels out the belongings of a fellow employee who was dismissed, outside of the Mary E. Switzer Federal Office Building, which houses offices for the US Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, DC, on April 1, 2025.Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesRelated articleTrump’s hardball moves leave fired federal workers few paths to fight for their jobs backIllston, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton who sits in San Francisco, said at a hearing earlier in the day that presidents have authority to make changes to the government, but when it comes to large scale reorganizations, presidents “must do so with the cooperation of Congress.The unions targeted specifically the role that DOGE was playing in the process, writing in court filings that the Elon Musk-led initiative was acting “largely in secret” to force cuts to agency spending and personnel by “refusing to reveal” the plans “to employees, their labor representatives, the public, or Congress.” The Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management – two agencies that have been central to DOGE’s mission – issued a joint directive that agencies submit the reduction and reorganization plans in two stages, due in mid-March and mid-April, with OMB giving final approval of the layoff plans, according to court filings.Illston’s order is among the most sweeping legal setbacks Trump and DOGE have faced in their efforts to drastically winnow down the federal bureaucracy. Across the federal government, the administration has been in the process of carrying out RIFS – or reductions in force – that would terminate tens of thousands of employees and shutter entire agency offices, with little regard for how the layoffs would impact an agency’s ability to meet its statutory obligations.The case before Illston could soon head to the Supreme Court, as the Justice Department indicated that it would like to appeal it quickly – though the judge denied a DOJ attorney’s request for a procedural maneuver that would make it easier for the administration to appeal her order immediately.In a 42-page opinion Friday night, Illston said, “No statute gives OPM, OMB, or DOGE the authority to direct other federal agencies to engage in large-scale terminations, restructuring, or elimination of itself.”While she will take a closer look at the merits of the lawsuit in the coming weeks, she found “it necessary to temporarily enjoin further implementation of those plans because they flow from likely illegal directives.”The order covers major reductions at more than a dozen agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Labor, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency.It additionally requires the administration to turn over by Tuesday the reduction plans, and to inform the judge by Tuesday about its efforts to carry out her order.In a statement, the challengers said they were “gratified by the court’s decision today to pause these harmful actions while our case proceeds.”“With every move this President is making, we are holding him accountable in court, and seeing judges of all stripes recognize and defend the rule of law,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is representing the challengers.CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.DOJ attorney Eric Hamilton argued Friday that the unions’ case suffered from a number of procedural defects, including a delay in bringing it, given that the executive order in question was signed on February 11. He argued that courts did not have the power to oversee challenges to the reduction plans because they were part of deliberative process and not a final agency action.Danielle Leonard, an attorney for plaintiffs, countered that any delay was the administration’s fault for refusing to be forthcoming with its plans and argued that that the administration was “trying to insulate from judicial review” a “pretty profoundly unlawful set of instructions.”The judge raised that some senators had asked the administration to produce its layoff plans. She asked the Justice Department if the administration had responded to that request. Hamilton refused to answer, arguing it was irrelevant to the case.This story has been updated with additional details.CNN’s Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

Among the claims wasthat two sourceshad told Torre that Hudson was prohibited from UNC’s football facility.When asked for comment, the university’s athletics department outright denied that reporting.“While Jordon Hudson is not an employee at the University or Carolina Athletics, she is welcome to the Carolina Football facilities,” Carolina Athletics said in a statement.“Jordon will continue to manage all activities related to Coach Belichick’s personal brand outside of his responsibilities for Carolina Football and the University.”Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson together in February 2025.Mike Coppola/Getty Images/FileRelated articleBill Belichick defends girlfriend Jordon Hudson after viral CBS interviewTorre responded in asocial media post on X, saying, “UNC can now choose to describe or change its position on Jordon Hudson’s involvement however it wishes, following the publication of our episode. We requested comment and filed dozens of FOIA requests that were not satisfied. And we stand by the specific reporting in our episode, which came from the highest levels of the football program.”Torre’s podcast and the athletics department’s subsequent denial is the latest flashpoint in Belichick’s unusual start to life in the college coaching ranks. The eight-time Super Bowl champion – six as head coach with the New England Patriots and two as an assistant with the New York Giants – was named the Tar Heels’ head football coach in December after spending a year away from the game after parting ways with the Patriots after the 2023-24 NFL season ended.Belichick’s father coached at the school in the 1950s and he described his arrival in Chapel Hill as a sort of homecoming for him, even saying inhis initial news conferencethat his first words were “Beat Duke” in reference to the Tar Heels’ archrivals.But in recent weeks, the 73-year-old’s relationship with Hudson has become the story of the UNC offseason.Bill Belichick, head coach of the New England Patriots holds the Vince Lombardi trophy after winning Super Bowl XXXVIII, 01 February 2004 at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.

The eight-minute CBS interview with Belichick was about his life in football ahead of the release of his new book, “The Art of Winning.”Dokoupil asked Belichick how he handles the public’s “invested” interest in his relationship with his girlfriend.“Never been too worried about what everybody else thinks,” Belichick said. “Just trying to do what’s best for me and what’s right.”Belichick was then asked how the pair met. Hudson interrupted from off-camera, saying, “We’re not talking about this.” Belichick said in a later statement that the couple met on a 2021 flight to Palm Beach, Florida. The admission matched an Instagram post from Hudson earlier this year, which she said they met in February 2021.Dokoupil later referred to Hudson as a “constant presence” during the taping of the interview.That interview set off a battle in the press between Belichick and CBS. Belichick accused the network of not honoring expectations about the scope of the interview while CBS denied that there were any preconditions or limitations to the conversation.During an appearance at the NFL Honors event in February, the age gap between Belichick and Hudson was the subject of multiple jokes,including by host Snoop Dogg.",

      "content": "CNN—Taylor Swifthas been subpoenaed in the case between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni.Swift – a longtime friend of Lively’s – was first mentioned in connection to the ongoing legal dispute between Lively and her “It Ends with Us” director and costar when text exchanges were revealed to include the name “Taylor” as part ofBaldoni’s $400 million defamation countersuitagainst Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds in January.One of the text messages included in Baldoni’s suit appears to show an exchange between Baldoni and Lively about the script for the film: “I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor),” Baldoni wrote with a wink emoji. “You really are a talent across the board. Really excited and grateful to do this together.”A spokesperson for Swift on Friday told CNN, “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see ‘It Ends With Us’ until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024.”“The connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, ‘My Tears Ricochet.’ Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift’s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case,” the spokesperson added.CNN has reached out to representatives for Baldoni for comment.When reached for comment later on Friday, a spokesperson for Lively said Baldoni and his legal team “continue to turn a case of sexual harassment and retaliation into entertainment for the tabloids.”“This is a very serious legal matter, not Barnum & Bailey’s Circus,” the spokesperson also said. “The defendants continue to publicly intimidate, bully, shame and attack women’s rights and reputations.”Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and retaliation in acomplaintfirst filed with the California Civil Rights Department in December, preceding a lawsuit that followed about a week later. She also claimed that Baldoni, along with his PR representatives, orchestrated a “social manipulation campaign” to hurt her reputation in the media while they were promoting “It Ends with Us,” their 2024 film at the center of the dispute.Blake Lively at the 2024 LACMA Art+Film Gala at in Los Angeles, California..Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty ImagesRelated articleBlake Lively will take the witness stand to testify during trial with Justin Baldoni, her lawyer saysVideo Ad FeedbackVideo shows Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively’s outtakes on the set of ‘It Ends With Us’02:57- Source:CNNVideo shows Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively’s outtakes on the set of ‘It Ends With Us’02:57In an amended complaint filed in February, Lively allegedother women also raised claimsabout Baldoni’s behavior on set.Baldoni has denied the allegations.Along with Lively, Reynolds is named as a defendant in the $400 million defamation lawsuit Baldoni filed in January.Baldoni hasaccusedReynolds of assisting Lively in “hijacking” his film and taking down his career. He claimed that Reynolds, who had no formal role on “It Ends With Us,” re-wrote a scene and made “unauthorized changes to the script in secret.” Baldoni also accused Reynolds of reprimanding him at the couple’s home in New York and alleged Reynolds made fun of him in “Deadpool & Wolverine,” mirroring the character Nicepool after Baldoni in an effort to mock him.An attorney for Reynolds filed a request for him to be dropped as a defendant from Baldoni’s suit, claiming that his argument against Reynolds has no legal bounds and amounts to “hurt feelings.”The trial in the case is set for March 2026.CNN’s Alli Rosenbloom contributed to this story.",

      "published_at": "2025-05-09 22:33",
      "content": "CNN—President Donald Trump has been personally involved in discussions inside the administration over potentially suspending habeas corpus, a legal procedure that allows people to challenge their detention in court, two people familiar with the consideration told CNN.One of Trump’s top aides, Stephen Miller, confirmed publicly Friday that the administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus, adding that it “depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.”Both the private discussions and Miller’s public comments show this is under serious consideration inside the West Wing.While Trump has not explicitly mentioned habeas corpus in public, it’s what he was referencing last month when he commented on steps he could take to combat nationwide injunctions against his actions on deportations, according to one of the people familiar with the talks.“There are ways to mitigate it and there’s some very strong ways,” Trump told reporters April 30. “There’s one way that’s been used by three very highly respected presidents, but we hope we don’t have to go that route. But there is one way used successfully by three presidents – all highly respected – and hopefully we don’t have to go that way but there are ways of mitigating it.”It remains unclear whether this is something the administration will actually pursue, and experts say it will likely generate legal challenges. The White House declined to comment beyond Miller’s statement.White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller speaks to the media outside the White House on Friday, May 9.Kent Nishimura/Reuters“Essentially everything Miller says about suspending habeas corpus – which would eliminate the ability of the courts to rule on immigration matters – is wrong,” CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said.“The Constitution makes clear that suspension of habeas corpus is to be reserved for actual rebellion or invasion posing the most dire threats to public safety. And Congress has never passed a law authorizing deportations without any court involvement, as Miller suggests.”The Constitution only allows habeas corpus to be suspended when “in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”Miller’s comments pick up on ongoing efforts by the Trump administration to use the current state of illegal border crossings to claim that the US is under invasion – which the administration says allows the government to eschew due process protections afforded to migrants. The administration is making a similar argument in defending Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, which would allow the government to quickly deport migrants without adherence to such due process procedures.Multiple judges, including a Trump appointee, have rejected the invocation, saying in rulings that the administration hadn’t shown the United States is under invasion by a hostile foreign power, as laid out under the 18th century statute.The Trump administration has also been examining whether it can label some suspectedcarteland gang members inside the US as “enemy combatants” as a possible way to detain them more easily and complicate their ability to challenge their imprisonment,CNN previously reported.Suspending the writ of habeas corpus would take Trump’s efforts even farther – allowing the government to detain migrants without giving them the opportunity to challenge that detention, essentially letting the administration detain people without providing justification.“The writ of habeas corpus has been suspended a number of times, but only in times of actual war or actual invasion, narrowly defined,” Ilya Somin, a professor of law at George Mason University, told CNN in January.While the Constitution does not explicitly require Congress’ approval for such a suspension, it’s long been understood that the legislature would likely need to play that role, as the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia has noted in a dissent.Somin said some states have also tried to claim, starting in the 1990s, that illegal immigration amounted to an invasion that would allow them to engage in war or to disregard federal laws that restrict immigration enforcement.“Every time courts have ruled on this, they have ruled against the states,” Somin said.Trump administration officials have made it clear that they believe the judicial branch is hindering their ability to enforce immigration laws. President Donald Trump has personally attacked judges in public statements, and Miller has likened court rulings against the administration to a “judicial coup.”In a sign of the mounting pressure, Chief Justice John Roberts stressed the importance of judicial independence during public remarks Wednesday.“The judiciary is a coequal branch of government, separate from the others with the authority to interpret the Constitution as law and strike down, obviously, acts of Congress or acts of the president,” Roberts said at an event in his native Buffalo, New York.The judiciary’s role, Roberts added, is to “decide cases but, in the course of that, check the excesses of Congress or the executive.”This headline and story have been updated with additional details.",

      "title": "Congress needs to address debt ceiling before its August recess to prevent default, Treasury secretary says | CNN Politics",

      "published_at": "2025-05-09 22:06",
      "content": "CNN—Lawmakers have until August to address the debt ceiling or the US could default on its obligations for the first time ever, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote to congressional leaders Friday, urging them to act even sooner, “to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.”The projection gives Republican lawmakers – who control Capitol Hill – a firmer deadline of when they have to pass their massive budget reconciliation bill, which aims to increase the debt ceiling along with extending the 2017 tax cuts and slashing federal spending.In his letter, Bessent said there is a “reasonable probability” that the cash and extraordinary measures that are allowing Treasury to continue paying the nation’s bills in full and on time will be exhausted in August, pointing out that is when Congress is scheduled to be in recess.But he noted that the projection is subject to “significant uncertainty.”“Therefore, I respectfully urge Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit by mid-July, before its scheduled break, to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,” he wrote.Treasury has been using cash and extraordinary measures to pay the nation’s bills in full and on time since January 21, when the US hit its roughly $36 trillion debt ceiling. Once the nation reaches that cap, which it has done repeatedly, it can no longer borrow to cover its obligations in full and on time. A default would likely cause global economic upheaval.House GOP leaders are closely monitoring projections for the so-called X-date, when the government could default, House Speaker Mike Johnson said at an Axios event in late April.“That’s a big pressure point, and we don’t know exactly when that X date will fall,” Johnson said, noting at the time that he was working under the assumption it could be as early as the beginning of June. “We can’t be caught flat-footed on this.”However, the caucus remains divided over how to address all three of its goals in the “big, beautiful bill,” leaving leaders with the tricky task of constructing a package that can get enough GOP votes to pass both chambers.In March, Bessent told lawmakers that he would continue using extraordinary measures – which are largely behind-the-scenes accounting maneuvers – through June 27.The Congressional Budget Office in Marchprojectedthat the “X-date” would be reached in August or September.Though they control Congress,Republicans are dividedover how to handle the debt ceiling. The House has included a $4 trillion increase to the cap inits budget resolution, while theSenate versionraises the limit by $5 trillion. President Donald Trump has pushed GOP lawmakers to address the limit as soon as possible.",

Now, a recent outbreak in one North Dakota county has led local health officials to quarantine nearly 200 unvaccinated students.North Dakota has reportednine measlescases this year, and a recent outbreak among schoolchildren in Williams County in the northwest part of the state has led local health officials to enforce a law that requires unvaccinated students to quarantine for 21 days after exposure to someone who has the virus. The move was taken by local public health officers in the Upper Missouri District Health Unit, and the state health department is assisting with mitigation efforts.On Tuesday, families of 188 unvaccinated students in the Williston Basin School District No. 7 received a letter informing them that their children wouldneed to quarantine for three weeks.Related articleWASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 30: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Texas has reported 709 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico reported 71 cases, and Oklahoma reported 17 cases – 14 confirmed and three probable – as of Friday. Cases in Kansas, which the state health department says may be linked to the outbreak, have reached 48 as of Wednesday. Experts say these numbers are all a severe undercount because many cases are going unreported.Since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, 2019 is only other year in which there were more than 1,000 cases, driven by large outbreaks in New York City and a nearby suburb. There were 1,274 confirmed measles cases that year, according to the CDC, only about 250 more than have been reported so far in 2025.Related vertical-videoCNN, CDCMeasles questions answered: When should my child be vaccinated?Nationwide, CDC data shows that 126 people have been hospitalized with measles this year – about 13% of all cases – and there have been three confirmed deaths associated with the large multistate outbreak: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated. The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 4% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to the CDC.There have been 14 total outbreaks this year, and 30 states have reported at least one case, according to the CDC.",

      "published_at": "2025-05-09 21:05",
      "content": "CNN—A few hours after President Donald Trump’s trade negotiating team boarded a flight for the most important economic meetings in the world, their boss took to social media to publicly throw a curveball into the negotiations.That was the point – not necessarily the path.Trump’s decision to float the possibility ofcutting his 145% tariffs on China to 80%gave the impression that Trump was negotiating with himself before the discussions started. But the substance of the message, was not a surprise to his top negotiators, who have discussed the possibility of lowering America’s tariff on China in internal discussions ahead of theUS-China talksin Geneva, Switzerland.But it was certainly news to Chinese officials.Trump’s feigned deference to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who he said in the post would make any final decision, was intended to elevate “Scott B” in the eyes of his Chinese counterparts. In reality, US officials are clear-eyed about the fact it will be Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping who will ultimately need to cement any major agreement.Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer landed in Geneva, Switzerland, for two days of meetings with top Chinese officials eyeing what may be viewed as less ambitious, but no less important, outcomes.White House officials have made clear theyview the China talks on a separate trackthan the furious scramble to secure trade agreements with dozens of other nations. Those negotiations are officially on the clock after Trump’s decision to pause the April 2nd “reciprocal” tariff rates for 90 days.Trump’s advisors have framed some of those bilateral negotiations as another lever to exert pressure on China’s economy, with a specific focus on securing early agreements with Indo-Pacific countries including South Korea and Japan.The White House approach to China is defined in its nascent stages as an altogether different approach separate and apart from the roughly 20 prioritized negotiations under way.Administration officials have framed a process intended to start with mutual steps toward de-escalation, followed by demands for specific moves by China to address Trump’s priorities, such as the facilitation of fentanyl production and resuscitating the first term US-China “Phase One” trade deal.Those steps would set the stage for more expansive discussions about the broader trade and economic relationship between the two nations.“This talk is about: Can we get to a stable place and maybe that’s a foundation for something more,” Greer said Thursday in an interview with CNBC.More immediate US concerns over export controls placed by China on rare earths may also drive potential early-stage agreements, but any kind of wide-ranging agreement is at best a long-term process.Unless, of course, Trump decides otherwise.Normal diplomacy vs. Trump’s wild cardCurrent and former administration economic advisors preface most conversations about negotiations with some variation of the fact Trump is the wild card that may decide to change course at any time.But Trump’s advisers are using this weekend’s meeting to forge a path out of a persistent and dangerous state of paralysis. They’ve seen positive signals in the lead up to talks that, after a monthslong stare own, came together in a familiar and deeply choreographed way.Both sides announced the scheduled meetings in a roughly coordinated fashion. Both sides insisted their top negotiators just happened to be passing through a city that has long served as a neutral third-country site for the most contentious diplomatic relationships. Both sides have generally maintained their public red lines that would seem to ensure little progress, while also messaging a new degree of flexibility through associated outlets.The officials set to lead the talks from both sides are the most tangible sign that the talks are serious and designed to substantively move toward de-escalation.He Lifeng, Xi’s top economic official and a long member of the Chinese leader’s inner circle, will lead the Chinese delegation. Wang Xiaohong, Xi’s top security aide, was also expected to attend, according to two people familiar with matter.Greer, who has engaged with most of the trade and economic officials expected to attend the meetings during his time across Trump’s first and second terms, said the manifest represented “folks who are serious.”“They’re sending real people to talk to us about real issues, so I’m confident that we can have a straightforward and candid discussion with these folks,” Greer said on CNBC.Bessent has become the public face of Trump’s economic team. Greer, a senior trade official in Trump’s first term who has played an increasingly central role within Trump’s economic team since his February Senate confirmation, brings a similar level of gravitas for the US side.National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who spoke to Bessent and Greer shortly before they boarded their flight Thursday evening, told reporters at the White House there have been “very promising signs” from the China side ahead of the meetings. He called the lead up the meeting an environment both sides have approached with “respect, collegiality and sketches of positive developments.”That baseline level of professional diplomacy is a stark shift from the first month of Trump’s second term, where Chinese officials tried in vain to connect with US counterparts and inner circle advisors, according to several people familiar with the matter.That left Chinese officials in a state of “frustration and confusion,” according to a European diplomat briefed on the matter. What soon became clear, the diplomat said, was how serious Trump was about completely re-orienting the bilateral relationship – and that his method would be economic force.China’s retaliation, which Trump and his advisors warned against, didn’t come as a surprise. But it did deepen a rupture in the relationship that threatens the global economy and has already created significant stress on the domestic economies of both nations.US officials have made clear publicly – and maintain privately – that the Chinese economy simply can’t sustain a drawn out trade war with the United States. They’ve been bolstered in that view by recent economic data they say underscores a combination of existing fragility in the country’s economic system and the acute risk posed by a de facto trade embargo with the world’s largest economy.Trump’s white whaleThe American officials pointed to quiet outreach from Chinese officials that sparked the planning for the meeting, with a top Xi security advisor communicating a desire to work toward addressing Trump’s major problems on the fentanyl issue.Trump’s fixation with Xi and a potential sweeping economic deal has been a prominent public feature of his first and second terms in the White House, often to the chagrin of his most hardline advisors.They view his overarching assessment of China as clear-eyed and focused on mitigating economic and security vulnerabilities. But there are no shortage of very specific examples of his willingness to break from any kind of linear hawkish approach.The pursuit of a grand economic deal may tempt him once again.“It’s his white whale,” a first-term Trump White House official told CNN. “Think of it like his desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize – a huge China deal is the economic version of that.”",

      "content": "CancerWomen's healthNew in medicineSee all topicsFacebookTweetEmailLinkLink Copied!FollowTo get screened for cervical cancer, patients in the United States may no longer need to put their feet in those awkward stirrups, brace for the uncomfortable speculum or even take the time off from work for an in-person doctor’s appointment.Soon, they will have the option to collect their own vaginal samples for screening from home – instead of a health care provider doing it for them.The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home self-collection device for cervical cancer screening in the United States, called the Teal Wand, according to the women’s health company Teal Health. Last year, the FDA gave the company’s Teal Wand “breakthrough device” status, allowing the agency to review it on a faster timeline.Teal Wand, which will be provided in Teal Health’s at-home self-collection kit, will require a prescription. Self-collected samples using the Wand are then mailed to a lab to be tested for HPV, thecompany announcedFriday. Mostcervical cancersare caused by human papillomavirus or HPV, and screening for HPV can help identify women who may be at risk of developing cervical cancer.Related articleGynecologist's Doctor Officeonurdongel/iStockphoto/Getty ImagesFDA greenlights self-collection of vaginal samples for cervical cancer screeningTypically, when screening for cervical cancer, gynecologists collect samples for HPV testing, cervical cytology or both. Cervical cytology, also known as a Pap test or Pap smear, involves examining cervical cells for changes to detect precancerous or cancerous cells. The HPV test checks cells for infection with the high-risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer.Last year, the FDA greenlit similar self-collection cervical cancer screening kits for use in a medical setting, such as at a doctor’s office, an urgent care or even a mobile clinic. At the time, two health care businesses – biotechnology companyRocheand medical technology firmBecton, Dickson and Company– said the FDA had approved the use of self-collected samples with their respective HPV tests.The Teal Health at-home kit allows a patient to collect their sample using the Teal Wand, which is then processed on Roche’s HPV test, said Kara Egan, Teal Health’s CEO. But a major difference is that the Teal Wand is approved to be used at home, so patients don’t have to travel to or make time for in-person doctor appointments.‘You can comfortably do it from home’To use Teal Health’s new self-collection kit, “you request a kit at the Teal website, meet with a provider who prescribes the kit, then comfortably and privately collect at home and mail to the lab to process on the Roche Cobas HPV test,” Egan said.“The results are then reviewed by a clinician and shared back,” she said. “If the results are positive, a provider will meet with you and refer you to any required follow-up.”Clinical trialdata from Teal Healthhas found that self-collection with the Teal Wand has the same accuracy for cervical cancer screening as when a health care provider collects a sample, Egan said.“It’s the same test, same accuracy, but you can comfortably do it from home,” she said. “It gives women more options, and with telehealth, we see more options to get access to care.”Teal Health plans to begin shipping its at-home self-collection kits in June, Egan said, starting in California before expanding nationwide. A waitlist is available at thecompany’s website.Related articleA self-collection kit for cervical cancer screenings is pictured.Courtesy BDWhy your next trip to the gyno might be different: There’s an alternative to Pap smearsTeal Health has been in talks with health insurance companies about having the self-collection kit covered, Egan added, and for people who don’t have insurance, the cost of the kit will be announced within the next month.The American Cancer Society applauded the new FDA approval.“Despite the benefits of cervical cancer screening, not all eligible are screened regularly,” Dr. William Dahut, the society’s chief scientific officer, said in an email Friday. “Most cervical cancers are found in people who have never had a cervical cancer screening test or who have not had one recently. That’s why today’s Food and Drug Administration’s announcement approving the first at-home test to screen for cervical cancer as an additional cancer screening method for this potentially deadly disease will make a huge impact.”Methods to screen for cervical cancerSome of the most important steps women can take to help reduce their risk for cervical cancer, according to theUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are to get vaccinated against HPV, avoid smoking, use condoms during sex, have regular screening tests and check with their doctor if their test results are not normal.It’s estimated that about 1 in 4 adults are not up to date on cervical cancer screening recommendations,according to data from 2021.“Some women are scared of a traditional pap smear or find the process uncomfortable, as a result they put off this vital test,” Dr.Ami Vaidya, co-chief of gynecologic oncology at Hackensack University Medical Center’sJohn Theurer Cancer Center, said in a news release Friday.The newly approved at-home screening device “could be an important tool in getting more women regularly screened, especially those that don’t have access to a medical provider,” Vaidya said. “Any type of test that helps detect cervical cancer is a win.”Related articleMauro_Scarone/E+/Getty ImagesCancer prevention report finds US smoking rates continue to fall but HPV vaccination rates stallTheUS Preventive Services Task Force recommendsscreening for cervical cancerwith cervical cytology – also known as a Pap test or Pap smear – every three years for women ages 21 to 29. For women 30 to 65, the USPSTF recommends screening every three years with cervical cytology alone, every five years with high-risk HPV testing alone, or every five years with high-risk HPV testing in combination with cytology.It’s estimated that about80% of people will get an HPV infectionin their lifetime. HPV, agroup of more than 150 viruses, is spread primarily through sexual contact and includes low-risk strains, which most often cause warts, and high-risk strains, which have been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, such as cervical, anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers. In most cases, HPV clears on its own within two years, butwhen the infection does not go away, health problems like cancer may occur.Screening for cervical cancer remains important because early cases often may not have signs or symptoms. Advanced cases may cause abnormal vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge. Cervical cancer is treated in many ways, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.",

      "content": "New YorkCNN—Bill Gates is calling out fellow tech billionaire Elon Musk over cuts made to US government spending under his watch through the Department of Government Efficiency, sayingthegutting of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) would lead to millions of deaths around the world.The warning comes after the Trump administration took steps to dismantle USAID and halt itsforeign assistance mission,with Muskbraggingabout feeding the agency to the “woodchipper.”In the weeks since, many non-profits have grappled with canceled contracts or sporadic payments, although some have since been restoredamid warningsfrom aid organizations about the potentially deadly consequences of cutting the funding.“When Elon went into government, if his thing really was about efficiency or using AI, you know, of course we need to make the government more efficient. If that’s what it had been, then it’s a praiseworthy thing to put his time and expertise (into),” Gates said in an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on Friday. “The fact that it turned into slashing these people, I didn’t expect that and some of that should be put back in place.”Gates added that the world is in a “global health emergency” because of spending cuts to health programs by the US and European governments. The full interview will air on Fareed Zakaria GPS on Sunday at 10 a.m. ET and 1 p.m. ET.The Microsoft cofounder’s comments comeafter he announced on Thursdayplans to give away $200 billion — including “virtually all” of his personal wealth — through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years before closing the organization, an acceleration of his previous spending plans. The decision was motivated in part, he said, by concerns that progress on improving global health is stagnating or even reversing.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates during a meeting with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta, Indonesia, Wednesday, May 7, 2025.Achmad Ibrahim/APRelated articleBill Gates announces plan to give ‘virtually all’ his money away and end the Gates Foundation in 20 yearsMusk’sactionswithin the Trump administration are now making matters worse, Gates said.“I think if you show up and say, in two months, you can cut $2 trillion out of a $7 trillion budget, you’re not going to succeed,” Gates said. “So you go for the softest things and things that are overseas, that you can mischaracterize… people that he hasn’t spent any time with.”Gates criticized, for example, Musk’s false claim in February that the US government was spending $50 billion on condoms for Gaza, which Musklater admittedwas incorrect. He also denounced Musk’s negative characterizations of USAID workers, whom Musk haspreviously called“radical lunatics” and “anti-American.” Gates called them “heroes.”“Other than the military, these are about as honorable and, you know, they’re the face of America to people who we want to be alive with us, and we want their health systems to be tracking potential pandemics,” Gates said. “Demonizing them is deeply unfair.”The Gates Foundation has spent more than $100 billion since its founding in 2000, partnering with government agencies and other nonprofits globally to tackle major health challenges. The organization’s work has included developing new vaccines, diagnostic tools and treatment delivery mechanisms to fight disease around the world.Gates said that while Musk is “a genius in some domains … in global health, it hasn’t been a focus.” He added: “If it was a modest cut and a challenge to be more efficient… I’m fine with that. But 80%, that’s going to be millions of deaths and it’s a mistake.”The comments followed an interview Gatesgave to the Financial Timesearlier this week, during which he accused Musk of “killing the world’s poorest children” with the government spending cuts.A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But it’s not the first time Musk and Gates have feuded over philanthropy. In 2022, Gates visited Musk in an effort to convince the Tesla CEO to increase his giving, but the meeting went sideways and afterwards Musk called Gates an “a-hole,” according to theMusk biographyby Walter Isaacson, for which he spoke to both billionaires.In the interview with Zakaria, Gates also raised concerns about other White House actions, including President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. The widespread tariffs threaten toraise costs for US consumersand upend operations for American businesses, just as AI is already expected to shake up the job market and economy.“The big concern I have is we’ve created a lot of uncertainty,” Gates said. “If you’re going to build a new factory, you need to understand the policies for the next 20 years, not just the next two days or even four years.”",

      "content": "ImmigrationFederal agenciesSee all topicsFacebookTweetEmailLinkLink Copied!FollowNewark, N.J.AP—Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested Friday at a federal immigration detention center where he has been protesting its opening this week and held in custody for several hours.Baraka  was released shortly after 8 p.m. and, after stepping out of an SUV  with flashing emergency lights, told waiting supporters: “The reality is  this: I didn’t do anything wrong.”Baraka said he could not speak about his case, citing a promise he made to lawyers and the judge. But he voiced full-throated support for everyone living in his community, immigrants included.“All of us  here, every last one of us, I don’t care what background you come from,  what nationality, what language you speak,” Baraka said, “at some point  we have to stop these people from causing division between us.”Baraka,  a Democrat who is running to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, has  embraced the fight with the Trump administration over illegal  immigration.He has aggressively pushed back against the construction and opening of the 1,000-bed detention center, arguing that it should not be allowed to open because of building permit issues.Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is led away in handcuffs after he took part in a protest outside an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, on May 9, 2025.News 12 New JerseyLinda Baraka, the mayor’s wife, accused the federal government of targeting her husband.“They didn’t arrest anyone else. They didn’t ask anyone else to leave. They wanted to make an example out of the mayor,” she said, adding that she had not been allowed to see him.A crowd gathered to protest outside the building where Baraka was being held, with many chanting, “Let the mayor go!”Alina Habba, interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said on the social platform X that Baraka committed trespass and ignored warnings from Homeland Security personnel to leave Delaney Hall, a detention facility run by private prison operator Geo Group.Habba said Baraka had “chosen to disregard the law” and added that he was taken into custody.Video of the incident showed that Baraka was arrested after returning to the public side of the gate to the facility.Video Ad FeedbackNewark mayor responds to Alina Habba’s claims about his arrest1:29- Source:CNNNewark mayor responds to Alina Habba’s claims about his arrest1:29Witnesses describe a ‘heated argument’Witnesses said the arrest came after Baraka attempted to join three members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation, Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman, in attempting to enter the facility.When federal officials blocked his entry, a heated argument broke out, according to Viri Martinez, an activist with the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. It continued even after Baraka returned to the public side of the gates.“There was yelling and pushing,” Martinez said. “Then the officers swarmed Baraka. They threw one of the organizers to the ground. They put Baraka in handcuffs and put him in an unmarked car.”In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the lawmakers had not asked for a tour of the facility. The department said further that as a bus carrying detainees was entering, “a group of protestors, including two members of the U.S. House of Representatives, stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility.”Homeland Security did not respond to questions about why only the mayor was arrested.Watson Coleman spokesperson Ned Cooper said the lawmakers went to the facility early in the afternoon unannounced because their plan was to inspect it, not to take a scheduled tour.“They arrived, explained to the guards and the officials at the facility that they were there to exercise their oversight authority,” he said, adding that they were allowed to enter and inspect the center sometime between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.DHS, in its statement issued after Baraka’s arrest, said Menendez, Watson Coleman and a number of protesters were currently “holed up in a guard shack” at the facility.“Members of Congress are not above the law and cannot illegally break into detention facilities. Had these members requested a tour, we would have facilitated a tour,” McLaughlin said.Watson Coleman, who left and was at a Homeland Security Investigations holding facility where Baraka was said to have been taken, said the DHS statement inaccurately characterized the visit.“Contrary to a press statement put out by DHS we did not ‘storm’ the detention center,” she wrote. “The author of that press release was so unfamiliar with the facts on the ground that they didn’t even correctly count the number of Representatives present. We were exercising our legal oversight function as we have done at the Elizabeth Detention Center without incident.”Video shows the mayor standing on the public side of the gateIn video of the altercation shared with The Associated Press, a federal official in a jacket with the logo of the Homeland Security Investigations can be heard telling Baraka he could not join a tour of the facility because “you are not a Congress member.”Baraka then left the secure area, rejoining protesters on the public side of the gate. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit, who said: “They’re talking about coming back to arrest you.”“I’m not on their property. They can’t come out on the street and arrest me,” Baraka replied.Minutes later several ICE agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded him and others on the public side. As protesters cried out, “Shame,” Baraka was dragged back through the security gate in handcuffs.“The ICE personnel came out aggressively to arrest him and grab him,” said Julie Moreno, a New Jersey state captain of American Families United. “It didn’t make any sense why they chose that moment to grab him while he was outside the gates.”An email and phone message left with the mayor’s communications office were not immediately answered Friday afternoon. Kabir Moss, a spokesperson for Baraka’s gubernatorial campaign, said, “We are actively monitoring and will provide more details as they become available.”Several civil rights and immigration reform advocates as well as government officials condemned Baraka’s arrest. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, whose office is defending a state law barring private immigration detention facilities, criticized the arrest during a seemingly peaceful protest and said no state or local law enforcement agencies were involved.Rep. Menendez said in a  statement that as members of Congress, they have the legal right to  carry out oversight at DHS facilities without prior notice and have done  so twice already this year. But on Friday, “Throughout every step of  this visit, ICE attempted to intimidate everyone involved and impede our  ability to conduct oversight.”The history of the facilityThe two-story building next to a county prison formerly operated as a halfway house.In February, ICE awarded a 15-year contract to The Geo Group Inc. to run the Newark detention center. Geo valued the contract at $1 billion, in an unusually long and large agreement for ICE.The announcement was part of President Donald Trump’s plans to sharply increase detention beds nationwide from a budget of about 41,000 beds this year.Baraka sued Geo soon after the deal was announced.Geo touted the Delaney Hall contract during its earnings call with shareholders Wednesday, with CEO David Donahue saying it was expected to generate more than $60 million a year in revenue. He said the facility began the intake process May 1.Hall said the activation of the facility and another in Michigan would increase total capacity under contract with ICE from around 20,000 beds to around 23,000.DHS said in its statement that the facility has the proper permits and inspections have been cleared.",

      "content": "CNN—President Donald Trump on Thursday fired three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency that creates safety requirements and issues recalls for consumer products, the commissioners said in statements.The move comes as the Trump administration is facing legal scrutiny over its efforts to permanently fire board members at independent agencies. All three fired CPSC commissioners – Richard Trumka Jr., Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Mary Boyle – were nominated by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate. Trumka’s and Hoehn-Saric’s terms were due to end in 2027 while Boyle’s was due to end later this year.Trumka said he received a visit from the Department of Government Efficiency on Thursday, alongside a request for approval to bring two DOGE members to the agency, which he didn’t allow. He got an email shortly thereafter telling him he had been fired.“On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Consumer Product Safety Commission is terminated effective immediately. Thank you for your service,” reads the email, which CNN has obtained.Trumka said the email didn’t explain why he was being fired.“Of course, he did not give any reason why. However, it immediately follows me doing two things that this Administration is against: (1) advancing solutions to protect the American people from harm, and (2) stopping the illegal firing of scores of public servants who do lifesaving work,” Trumka said in a statement Friday.Trumka has made it clear he plans on challenging the move in court, writing Trump “did not have the authority to fire me.”“I have a set term on this independent, bipartisan Commission that does not expire until October of 2028, and I will continue protecting the American people from harm through that time,” Trumka wrote. “The President would like to end this nation’s long history of independent agencies, so he’s chosen to ignore the law and pretend independence doesn’t exist. I’ll see him in court.”He warned that if his “illegal firing is allowed to stand, it will clear the way for the Administration and its lapdogs to cripple the lifesaving functions of this agency to benefit their wealthy donors.”Hoehn-Saric was the chair of the commission until January, after which he became a commissioner. In a statement posted on social media, he described the terminations as “part of the Trump Administration’s ongoing attack on federal agencies and federal workers to the detriment of the American public.”Boyle said in a statement that threats to the agency’s independence have come “fast and furious” since Trump’s inauguration, “halting our agenda and undermining our safety work – through countless exercises designed to distract our staff and instill in them fear for their livelihoods.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Friday defended Trump’s decision to fire the officials when asked about the dismissals.“It’s a federal agency within which branch? It’s the executive branch. Who’s the head of the executive branch? The president of the United States. He has the right to fire people within the executive branch. It’s a pretty simple answer,” Leavitt said.Consumer Reports, a nonprofit that helps consumers evaluate goods and services, condemned the move on Friday and called for Congress to defend CPSC.“This is an appalling and lawless attack on the independence of our country’s product safety watchdog. Anyone who cares about keeping their family safe should oppose this move and demand that it be reversed,” said William Wallace, director of safety advocacy for Consumer Reports.The Supreme Court isset to weigh inon whether the president has the authority to permanently fire board members at two similar independent agencies — the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board.The commissioners are the latest public servants to be removed from their positions during Trump’s second term. The White House on Thursday notified Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden thatshe would be fired, while not making the reason for her removal immediately clear.This story has been updated with additional details.CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

      "content": "CNN—The Pentagon has ordered all military academies to identify and remove books from their libraries that deal with issues such as race, gender ideology, and other “divisive concepts” that are now considered “incompatible with the department’s core mission,” according to a memo obtained by CNN.The memo, dated Friday, is signed by the acting deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness and also announces the creation of a temporary Academic Libraries Committee “comprised of knowledgeable leaders, educators, and library professionals” from across the Defense Department who will help identify and “sequester” the offending books for further review.The books must be identified and set aside for review by May 21, the memo says.The committee has already developed a list of search terms to help military leaders identify books that may need to be removed. The terms include: “Affirmative action,” “anti-racism,” “allyship,” “diversity in the workplace,” “gender transition,” “white privilege,” and “critical race theory,” according to an attachment to the memo.The establishment of a special committee to review books for removal across the military academies marks an escalation of the Defense Department’s efforts to eliminate “diversity, equity, and inclusion” content across the military.Ina separate memoreleased on Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also said there will be “no consideration of race, ethnicity, or sex” in admissions to US military academies, which will focus admissions “exclusively on merit.” The memo ordered the service academies to rank candidates, starting with the 2026 admissions cycle, “by merit-based scores,” accepting the highest-ranking candidates in each nomination category.“Merit-based scores may give weight to unique athletic talent or other experiences such as prior military service or performance at a MSA preparatory school,” the memo says. It’s unclear how the directive will impact the ability of US senators to recommend people for admission to the military academies.The Naval Academy has already removed nearly 400 books from its main library in an attempt to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order in January mandating the removal of all “diversity, equity, and inclusion” content from K-12 schools, which Hegseth later said also applied to military academies.The Naval Academy also canceled a lecture that author Ryan Holiday was scheduled to give to students there last month after he refused to remove slides from his planned presentation that criticized the academy’s decision to remove the books, CNN reported.A tenured professor of philosophy at West Point wrote inan op-ed for the New York Timeson Thursday that he was resigning after 13 years at the school because it was “suddenly eliminating courses, modifying syllabuses and censoring arguments to comport with the ideological tastes of the Trump administration.” The professor, Graham Parsons, wrote that West Point was interpreting Hegseth’s order “broadly,” and conducting “a sweeping assault on the school’s curriculum and the faculty members’ research.”In response to Parson’s op-ed, Hegseth posted on X on Thursday, “You will not be missed Professor Parsons,” and the DoD’s rapid response account called Parsons “woke.”Students and parents alsotold CNN last monththat the anti-DEI policy is having a direct impact on students at Defense Department schools around the globe, as classes like AP Psychology and certain student clubs and books have been banned from DoD schools. The ACLU has sued DoD over the policy.Meanwhile, articles about the Holocaust, the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, cancer awareness, sexual assault and suicide prevention were among the tens of thousands either removed or flagged for removal from Pentagon websites as the department scrambled to comply with Hegseth’s order.The Friday memo standing up the libraries committee said the review of the book removals would be “deliberate” and conducted by “experts in the fields of education and the department’s mission.”",

      "content": "CNN—Cassie Ventura, the former girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs and one of his accusers, could take the stand as early as Monday as one of the first three witnesses called in the government’s sex-trafficking case against the music mogul.Prosecutors indicated in court on Friday that they would call two “quick” witnesses before calling “Victim 1,” whose testimony will take up most of the first week. Ventura, who is pregnant with her third child and due to deliver next month, is referred to as “Victim 1” in the indictment but has agreed to testify in her own name.Prosecutors allege Combs coerced her into having sex with male prostitutes, according to the indictment. Combs’ attorneys have said all sex was consensual.Combs’ defense team said in court they plan to argue that Ventura had a propensity for violence toward Combs during their relationship, which lasted approximately 11 years, from 2007 to 2018.“We are going to take the position that there was mutual violence in their relationship,” defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said in court Friday.“That there was hitting on both sides,” Agnifilo added. “We’re probably going to refer to it as domestic violence.”The defense attorneys said they may want to ask Ventura about violent interactions they say she’s had unrelated to the allegations in this case, which they allege will discredit the claim Combs coerced her into sexual activity. The judge said he would rule on that Monday.Combs nodded when his lawyer Alexandra Shapiro said, “The dynamic between these two individuals is at the very heart of this case.”Ventura’s attorney, Douglas Wilder, declined to comment when contacted by CNN.Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all charges, he could be sentenced to life in prison.Among the topics likely to be raised in Ventura’s testimony is hotel surveillance footage from 2016 that shows Combs grabbing, kicking and dragging her.Surveillance video shows Sean 'Diddy' Combs physically assaulting former girlfriend in 201603:04- Source:CNNSurveillance video shows Sean 'Diddy' Combs physically assaulting former girlfriend in 201603:04Despite attempts by his attorneys to exclude the footage from evidence,Judge Arun Subramanianissued a ruling last month that it could be shown to the jury at trial.After CNN first published video of the incident last May, Combsposted an apologyon his Instagram account, saying, “My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.”Jury selection and opening statementsJury selection was initially set to be finalized on Friday, but Judge Subramanian expressed concern that some prospective jurors could get cold feet before the start of opening statements on Monday.The judge struck two jurors from the prospective pool of 45, reducing the overall pool to 43. One woman who was qualified earlier in the week contacted the court expressing issues of personal well-being, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said in court. A man was struck from the pool because he didn’t disclose an open lawsuit he’s pursuing against the city of New York during questioning.U.S. Marshalls sit behind Sean \"Diddy\" Combs as he sits at the defense table alongside lawyers Marc Agnifilo and Brian Steel in the courtroom in New York on May 9.Jane Rosenberg/Reuters“We may be in a situation where on Monday we’re starting out already down some alternate jurors,” the judge said.Assistant US attorney Maurene Comey said the government “strongly oppose” any delays.“If one raises his or her hand and says I have an issue we could have an avalanche effect,” she said. “We are also working against a clock on our end which we’re very cognizant of next week.”Judge Subramanian said the pool of 43 will be called to arrive by 8:30am Monday morning, so they can start opening statements at 9:30 as originally planned.The trial is anticipated to last eight weeks.CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this report.",

The show wrapped two years after a controversy involving former staff members, who alleged they faced intimidation and racism while working on the popular daytime show.DeGeneresissued an apologyto her staff in July 2020.“On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that ‘The Ellen DeGeneres Show’ would be a place of happiness – no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect,” DeGeneres said then. “Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it’s the opposite of what I believe and what I hoped for our show.”She joked about the situation in her Netflix comedy special, “Ellen’s Last Stand…Up.”“Let me catch you up on what’s been going on with me since you last saw me,” she said. “I got chickens.

      "content": "New in medicineFederal agenciesFood & healthSee all topicsFacebookTweetEmailLinkLink Copied!FollowSign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better:Mediterranean Style.Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.The US Food and Drug Administration has approved three new color additives from natural sources “that will expand the palette of available colors from natural sources for manufacturers to safely use in food,” the agency said ina news release.The three dyes are Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract and calcium phosphate.US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made phasing outpetroleum-based dyesin the nation’s food supply one of the priorities in his broader initiative to “Make America Healthy Again.”The flower petals of the butterfly pea flower plant provide a vibrant blue hue to foods and beverages.Oksana Shufrych/Zoonar/dpa/picture alliance/Sipa USAArtificial food dyes are facing new restrictions or bans at both the federal level and in more thanhalf the states. In April, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced the agency would work with the industry to remove and replace the dyes, though the FDA largely hasn’t yet made this a requirement for industry.“For too long, our food system has relied on synthetic, petroleum-based dyes that offer no nutritional value and pose unnecessary health risks,” Kennedy said in a news release. “We’re removing these dyes and approving safe, natural alternatives — to protect families and support healthier choices.”The FDA approving these natural colorants is a step forward, said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental health organization.“Thanks to the FDA, food companies will have even more options they can use as they switch from synthetic colors to natural colors,” Faber said via email.“While it’s good news that the FDA has acted on industry petitions to approve natural colors, it’s bad news, however, that the FDA has failed to acton our petitionsto ban harmful ingredients in food, including chemicals linked to cancer” and other health issues, Faber added.Those chemicals includephthalates, synthetic chemicals used in food packaging and other everyday products, and PFAS (per- andpolyfluoroalkyal substances), used in many consumer products and commercial uses. Others areperchlorate, an antistatic agent for food packing;titanium dioxide, a white pigment; and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), a preservative.3 new natural food dyesGaldieria extract blue derives from Galdieria sulphuraria, a type of red algae that carries a water-soluble blue pigment known as C-Phycocyanin and is found in acidic volcanic hot springs and calderas, according to the FDA and Fermentalg, a French chemical company using micro-algae for colorants, foods and supplements.Fermentalg sought approval for the additive for foods and beverages via a petition it submitted to the FDA in 2021 and has patented a Galdieria sulphuraria extract underthe name Everzure.Galdieria sulphuraria’s natural ability to reside in acidic environments lends to its stability in food and beverages, which is something food and beverage manufacturers have been concerned about in the shift to natural alternatives to highly stable artificial dyes.Butterfly pea extract is a blue color from which manufacturers can create a range of shades including bright blues, intense purples and natural greens, according to the FDA. It’s produced from the water extraction of the dried flower petals of the butterfly pea plant, and is already approved for some uses, including sports drinks, fruit drinks, fruit and vegetable juices, alcoholic beverages, candy and ice creams.Its use is now expanded to also include ready-to-eat cereals, crackers, snack mixes, hard pretzels, plain potato chips, plain corn chips, tortilla chips and multigrain chips, the FDA said. The petition that raised this extract for consideration was submittedin February 2024by the St. Louis-based Sensient Colors, one of the largest global dye-makers.Calcium phosphate, a mineral compound containing both calcium and phosphorus, provides a white color newly approved for use in ready-to-eat chicken products, white candy melts, doughnut sugar and sugar for coated candies, according to the FDA, whose decision approvesa 2023 petitionfiled by New Jersey-based Innophos Inc., a mineral solutions company.“The FDA determines whether an additive is safe to use by considering the projected human dietary exposure to the color additive, the additive’s toxicological data, and other relevant information, such as published literature,” the agency stated in a news release.The pros and cons of natural colorsThe embrace of natural dyes is due to health concerns around artificial colorants, such asincreased risk of cancerand neurobehavioral issues. While some manufacturers acknowledge these concerns, they have also highlighted the challenges involved in an industrywide shift to alternative dyes, which is likely due to both state-level bans and the FDA’s requirement that food companies remove red dye No. 3 — banned in January — from foods by January 15, 2027.“This process is neither simple nor immediate and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,” the International Association of Color Manufacturers said inan April statement.“Natural colors can be more expensive from a cost-in-use perspective depending on the raw ingredient being used,” Amy Agallar, vice president of investor relations and treasurer at Sensient, said via email May 2. “The raw ingredients can vary due to many factors such as availability, time to harvest and color availability from the raw material. The natural color needed to replace a synthetic color can be ten times that of a synthetic product.”That discrepancy is partly due to some food and beverage products requiring heat processing or acids that affect the stability of natural colors, Agallar added. “Some natural colors are also not very light stable and this may be needed in the end application.”Additionally, “studies show that customers prefer products with color and are more likely to purchase food and beverages with a color that matches the expected flavor,” Agallar said. “Consumers use the color to identify how a product will taste. Food manufacturers currently use natural color products in about 80% of new colored food and beverages released in the US each year.”People will have to get used to paler shades, and that will probably take some time, Dr. Marion Nestle, Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, Emerita, at New York University, said via email. “The time for the artificial neon colors to disappear is long overdue.”There’s little funding for research on artificial food dyes, and even less for the study of emerging alternatives — so it’s not yet known whether these new natural dyes could have any effect on human health.“We need to be careful not to rush these decisions, as they must be based on strong supporting data (and) thoroughly evaluated,” said Dr. Monica Giusti, professor and associate chair of the department of food science and technology at Ohio State University. “We must remember that natural does not necessarily mean safe; there are many potent toxins that come from nature.”But with most natural dyes coming from plants and being used in small quantities, “it’s hard to believe they’d have any effect” on the general population, Nestletold CNN in a previous story.Sensient has developed its own safety program, Certasure, Agallar said. “This program ensures that our natural colors are free of pesticides, heavy metals, microbiological contamination, adulteration, and unauthorized solvents.”",

      "content": "Student lifeFederal agenciesCampus protestsSee all topicsFacebookTweetEmailLinkLink Copied!FollowTufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk on Saturday arrived in her home state of Massachusetts after she was snatched by masked federal agents near her home and spent six weeks in ICE detention as part of the Trump administration’s effort to deport noncitizens who have spoken out against the war in Gaza.She landed at Boston Logan International Airport Saturday evening, a day after US District Judge William K. Sessions III ordered her immediate release.“America is the greatest democracy in the world, and I believe in those values that we share. I have faith in the American system of justice,”Öztürksaid Saturday at a news conference at the airport. “This has been very difficult time for me, for my community, for my community at Tufts, at Turkey, but I’m so grateful for all the support, kindness, and care.”Öztürk said she will continue to pursue her case in court as she gets back to her studies and research work.A chilling video of Öztürk’sMarch 25 arrestshowed a swarm of officers encircling her near her Somerville, Massachusetts home as she shrieked in fear, sparking national outrage. Her detention more than 1,500 miles away from her home – part of a series of high-profile arrests of international students who participated in pro-Palestinian activism – has triggered widespread protests and raised concerns over due process and free speech on university campuses.Hours after the judge ordered her release, a smilingÖztürkwas surrounded by a group of supporters who chanted “Rümeysa! Rümeysa!” as she walked out of the detention center Friday evening.Dressed in a pink blouse and beige pants, Öztürk, who appeared elated, held her hands over her heart and could be heard thanking the supporters who had gathered outside the detention center holding up signs that read “Free Rumeysa. Free speech for all.”“It’s a feeling of relief, and knowing that the case is not over, but at least she can fight the case while with her community and continuing the academic work that she loves at Tufts,” Esha Bhandari, an attorney for Öztürk, told CNN.Öztürk’s parents said they were overjoyed by the decision. “We are very happy as a family. We hugged each other and cried tears of joy,” her mother, Tuğba Öztürk, told Turkish state-run news agencyAnadolu.Rümeysa Öztürk speaks at a press conference at Boston Logan International Airport on Saturday.WHDHÖztürk’s arrest came a year after Öztürk co-authored a campus newspaper op-ed that was critical of Tufts University’s response to the war in Gaza, and her attorneys have said that she was targeted by the administration in an attempt to chill pro-Palestinian speech in violation of her constitutional rights. The 30-year-old, originally from Turkey and on a valid F-1 student visa, was shuttled through multiple states after her arrest and suffered through a series of asthma attacks without adequate medical care, according to her attorneys.Öztürk, who has not been charged with any crime, was accused by the Trump administration of participating in activities in support of Hamas. Neither the administration nor attorneys for the Department of Justice presented any evidence of her alleged activities in court.Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts rallied alongsideÖztürkand her lawyers at the news conference in Boston Saturday evening, calling her a symbol of the fight against violations of free speech and due process.“It’s a victory for Rümeysa. It’s a victory for justice. It’s a victory for our democracy,” Markey said of her release. “Freedom of speech and the right of due process are not suggestions in our country. They are fundamental rights.”“Massachusetts did not forget about you for a minute,” Pressley said, addressing Öztürk. “Your classmates and your neighbors peacefully gathered in the street, lawyers, elected officials and people of good conscience from every walk of life spoke your name daily.”Sessions presided over the more than three-hour hearing Friday, where four witnesses – including Öztürk – testified about her community engagement work and her asthma. Sessions said Öztürk had raised “substantial claims” of both due process and First Amendment violations.Rümeysa Öztürk speaks to members of the press and others gathered outside the Louisiana detention center where she was held.KATC“Continued detention potentially chills the speech of the millions and millions of individuals in this country who are not citizens. Any one of them may now avoid exercising their First Amendment rights for fear of being whisked away to a detention center,” Sessions said.Sessions noted that for multiple weeks, except for the op-ed, the government failed to produce any evidence to support Öztürk’s continued detention. “That is literally the case,” Sessions said. “There is no evidence here as to the motivation absent the consideration of the op-ed.”Nothing in Öztürk’s co-authored op-ed from 2024 violated the university’s policies, Tufts University spokesperson Mike Rodman told CNN in a statement Saturday. “Rümeysa is a student in good standing,” the statement read.The judge ordered her release without any travel restrictions or ICE monitoring.Related articleTufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk was arrested by plainclothes officers and moved to a detention center in Louisiana.Muslim Justice LeagueA PhD student was snatched by masked officers in broad daylight. Then she was flown 1,500 miles away“In light of the Court’s finding of no risk of flight and no danger to the community, Petitioner is to be released from ICE custody immediately on her own recognizance, without any form of Body-Worn GPS or other ICE monitoring at this time. Petitioner is not subject to any travel restrictions” Sessions wrote in Friday’s order.Despite the judge’s decision, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement attempted to delay Öztürk’s release from the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana, her attorneys told CNN.“Despite the 11th hour attempt to delay her freedom by trying to force her to wear an ankle monitor, Rümeysa is now free and is excited to return home, free of monitoring or restriction,” attorney Mahsa Khanbabai said.A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Öztürk is one ofseveralinternational university students facing deportation as part of theTrump administrationdeportation efforts, which include a focus on pro-Palestinian protesters and activists on college campuses. The arrests of scholars and students at the hands of masked law enforcement officers, who have taken them into custody by ambushing them on city streets and near their homes, have sent a chill across the international student community.The decision in Öztürk’s case came the same day the administration was dealt another loss after the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York denied an appeal to stay a lower court’s order to release Columbia University student and lawful permanent resident Mohsen Mahdawi. In its appeal, the Trump administration had sought to re-arrest Mahdawi while his immigration proceedings play out. The decision from the Second Circuit allows Mahdawi to remain released on bail during proceedings.As attorneys in Öztürk’s immigration case fight her visa revocation, the habeas petition in her federal case will be argued at a May 22 proceeding in the District of Vermont. Her attorneys hope the judge “will ultimately hold that, in fact, the government cannot detain, apprehend and seek to punish people who express those political views.”“This really is part of a bigger picture push to make sure that the rule of law still prevails,” Bhandari said.Photos show Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk outside a detention center in Basile, Louisiana, on Friday, where she had been detained for more than six weeks.Öztürk’s legal teamJudge says Öztürk was ‘suffering as a result of her incarceration’A medical expert and Öztürk, who appeared virtually at the Friday bail hearing wearing an orange uniform over a long-sleeved white shirt with a beige hijab, testified that her asthmatic episodes have increased in number and severity since the start of her detention.Her first asthma attack while in detention happened at the Atlanta airport shortly after she was arrested, she said. At the time, Öztürk only had her emergency inhaler with her because she was on her way to break her fast during Ramadan when she was arrested. While the medical expert was testifying, Öztürk had to briefly step out because she was having an asthma attack.As he was issuing his decision, the judge noted Öztürk is asthmatic and “suffering as a result of her incarceration … she may very well suffer additional damage to her health, that’s an extraordinary circumstance.” Sessions emphasized the need for her to be released quickly.As part of her release conditions, he ordered her to check in with a social services group that will assist her while the case proceeds.“The court finds that she does not pose a danger to the community, nor does she present a risk of flight,” Sessions said. “Ms. Öztürk is free to return to her home in Massachusetts.”Sessions noted Öztürk’s detention “has been a very traumatic incident” and ordered regular check-ins with an adult restorative services provider at the Burlington Community Justice Center.“The idea, of course, is for her to try to reintegrate into the Somerville community after what has been a very traumatic incident,” Sessions continued. “I think that this support, and also the reporting requirements, will assist in that way.”Tufts spokesperson Rodman told CNN the university hopes she can rejoin the community as soon as possible and said she will be provided on-campus housing upon her return.“We’re pleased that the court has approved Rümeysa’s request to be released on bail, and we look forward to welcoming her back to campus to resume her doctoral studies,” Rodman said.Öztürksaid Saturday that her advisor sent her dissertation proposal to the detention center and professors and students sent her letters of support while she was in detention. Her labmates read her books on the phone.“In the last 45 days, I lost both my freedom and also my education during a crucial time for my doctoral studies,” she said. “I am so excited to get back to my studies, community, friends, professors and my students.”Following the hearing, her attorney Khanbabai said in a statement she was “relieved and ecstatic that Rümeysa has been ordered released.”“Unfortunately, it is 45 days too late. She has been imprisoned all these days for simply writing an op-ed that called for human rights and dignity for the people in Palestine,” Khanbabai said. “When did speaking up against oppression become a crime? When did speaking up against genocide become something to be imprisoned for?”",

      "content": "RomeCNN—On most days, the Sistine Chapel is one of the world’s busiest tourist destinations, but this week it served as the world’s most secretive polling station as 133 cardinals voted for the 267th pope.On Friday, the chapel was restored to its central purpose: A place of worship.There, the newly elected pontiff,Leo XIV, held a private service for the cardinals, marking his first Mass as the leader of the Catholic Church and its 1.4 billion members.Leo, a 69-year-old from Chicago – who was until Thursday known as Cardinal Robert Prevost – made history on Thursday when he became the first pope from the United States.It has often been said that cardinal electors would always shy away from choosing an American pope due to the outsized global political influence of the United States. It’s possible that Leo’s long experience in Peru – where he is also a citizen – may have mitigated those fears among the electors.Newly elected Pope Leo XIV waves from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday.Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersRelated article10 things to know about Robert Prevost, who is now Pope Leo XIVCardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, told reporters on Friday that Leo’s nationality was irrelevant in the decision making process.“He’s the father of the church universal; where he came from, secondary,” Dolan said.Asked whether the cardinals chose Leo to counteract US President Donald Trump – who the pope’s predecessor Francis sharply disagreed with on a host of issues including immigration and climate change – Dolan said it was not a significant factor.“It should not startle us that we would look to Pope Leo as a bridge builder. That’s what the Latin word ‘pontiff’ means,” Dolan said.Cardinal Wilton Daniel Gregory, Archbishop of Washington, also dismissed the idea that the vote was a “counterweight” against the US president.The conclave was not “a continuation of the American political election,” Gregory said, adding: “It wasn’t an election conclave – it was a desire to strengthen the Christian faith among God’s people.”Leo alluded to that mission in his Mass on Friday, first speaking in his native English in thanking the cardinals for calling on him “to carry the cross” of the Catholic Church, before switching to Italian.Leo used his first homily to urge the priesthood to show humility and make itself “small,” a call that strongly echoes the priorities of Francis, who devoted much of his papacy to reaching the “peripheries” of the globe.He urged the church to continue its “missionary outreach” to the corners of the world where it is “desperately needed.”Leo XIV leaves the Sistine Chapel after leading his first Mass as pope on Friday.Vatican Media/APThere have already been plenty of overlaps between Leo and Francis, from Leo’s choice of shoes to his apparent criticism of Trump’s stance on immigration. Leo’s brother, John Prevost, even said his brother will be like “a second Pope Francis.”But just how closely Leo will follow the Franciscan path is not yet clear. Leo’s past comment suggests he may tack more closely to traditional Catholic doctrine. Whereas Francis had made efforts to include women in ordained ministries, Prevost said in 2023 that he was not open to changing the tradition that confers priestly ordination only on men.Now they are no longer sequestered, some of the other voting cardinals have begun to explain why the conclave chose Prevost as pope.“It is clear from the speed with which Pope Leo’s election was done that Pope Francis had left the Church more united than naysayers would give him credit for,” Cardinal Arthur Roche, a British cardinal who voted in the conclave, told CNN.Roche said while there have been reforms across recent papacies, the conclaves have also opted for candidates offering continuity on the essentials of Catholic doctrine.“In Pope Leo we have a pastor of proven pastoral, theological and administrative experience combined with those human and spiritual qualities that are warmly welcoming and do not alienate,” Roche added.Although Friday is Leo’s first day as pope, his papacy will officially begin on May 18 with an inaugural Mass held in St. Peter’s Square. His first general audience with the public will be held on May 21.CNN’s Sharon Braithwaite and Eric Bradner contributed reporting.",

      "content": "CNN—Six weeks before American Cardinal Robert Prevost became Pope Leo XIV, the activist group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) fileda complaintagainst him, along with other church leaders, to the Vatican’s Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin.The group alleged Prevost “harmed the vulnerable and caused scandal” by mishandling two situations – in Chicago in 2000, and in Peru in 2022 – involving priests accused of sexual abuse.The group said that as provincial supervisor in Chicago for the Augustinian order in 2000, Prevost allowed a priest accused of abusing at least 13 minors to live at the Augustinian order’s St. John Stone Friary in Hyde Park, half a block from St. Thomas the Apostle Elementary School. The priest, Father James Ray, had been barred since 1991 from performing parish work or being alone with minors – restrictions the Archdiocese of Chicago noted when it asked Prevost to allow Ray to live at the friary, the complaint said.“The school was never notified,” said SNAP spokeswoman Sarah Pearson. In 2002, after the US Conference of Catholic Bishops tightened their policies, Ray was moved from the priory and removed from public ministry. He was removed from the priesthood in 2012.News outlets work outside the Holy Name Cathedral after Cardinal Robert Prevost, who was born in Chicago, had been named as first American leader of the Catholic Church in Chicago, Illinois, on May 8, 2025.

He returned there in 2015, when Pope Francis appointed him as Bishop of the diocese of Chiclayo, in northwestern Peru. In April 2022, three women filed a complaint to Prevost accusing two priests there of sexual abuse beginning in 2007, when they were minors,as reportedby The Pillar, a Catholic investigative journalism project.In December 2022, the women filed civil complaints, saying the diocese had failed to act or inform civil authorities about their allegations. But prosecutors closed the case a month later, saying the statute of limitations had expired, according to SNAP’s complaint.The diocese denied the women’s allegations, saying that Prevost met with them personally when they filed their initial complaint. The diocese said it suspended one priest after the complaint, and that the other was no longer in ministry because of his age and poor health. It also said it forwarded their complaint to higher-ups in Rome, to an office known as the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. But the dicastery closed that case in August 2023, after the diocese notified it of the dismissal of the civil case.SNAP’s March 25 complaint alleges that Prevost, as bishop, failed to open an investigation, properly inform civil prosecutors, or restrict the priests involved.The women also said church investigators never talked to them, SNAP’s Pearson told CNN. “The fact they say they weren’t even interviewed is extremely concerning to us.”Prevost’s successor as Bishop of Chiclayo, Guillermo Cornejo, reopened the case in December 2023 and called for a new investigation, after one of the three women went public with her accusations, as first reported byThe Pillarlast year.People gather at the Cathedral of Saint Mary, on the day of the election of Pope Leo XIV, in Chiclayo, Peru May 8, 2025. REUTERS/Sebastian CastanedaSebastian Castaneda/ReutersWhile he served as Bishop of Chiclayo, Prevost told the Peruvian national newspaperLa Republicain 2019 that, “We reject cover-ups and secrecy” about sexual abuse cases. “They cause a lot of harm, because we have to help people who have suffered due to wrongdoing.”He urged people to come forward if they’re aware of abuse against minors by a priest. “On behalf of the Church, we want to tell people that if there has been any offense; if they have suffered or are victims of the wrongdoing of a priest, they should come and report it, so we can act for the good of the Church, the person, and the community.”Rodolfo Soriano Nuñez, a sociologist in Mexico City who has written extensively about the Roman Catholic church and its handling of clerical sexual abuse, said that, for any failings, Prevost was one of the few bishops in Peru who tried seriously to address sexual abuse by priests, setting up a commission to deal with such cases.“I think Prevost was the best bishop in Peru when dealing with abuse cases in his diocese. And there were plenty of cases,” said Soriano-Nuñez. “He dealt with the issue as far as he was able to deal with it.” Unlike some of his counterparts elsewhere in Peru and the rest of Latin America, he said, Prevost was not “going after the victims, or gaslighting the victims or playing the fool.”More broadly, Soriano-Nuñez said he finds it encouraging that the new Pope Leo XIV was not a prince of the church. For most of his career, “He wasn’t in Rome, or in Paris. He was a poor Augustinian priest in Peru. He was working with peasants, learning Quechua. Learning Spanish is easy for English speakers. But learning Quechua, that takes time.”Pearson said SNAP has not heard back from the Vatican about its complaint.  “Knowing that Prevost is now Leo XIV, we’re concerned whether this will ever be investigated.” She added, “We’re calling for a zero-tolerance law, to permanently remove from the ministry anyone found to have abused children… and there has to be independent oversight and a means through which they can be held accountable.”She said SNAP is calling on the new pope to “apologize for his shortcomings and put these investigations in the hands of people who are not part of the Vatican. If he doesn’t do that, he won’t have the credibility survivors need him to have, if this cycle of abuse in the Catholic Church is ever to end.”",

      "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style.Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.CNN—Few things are as impressive to dinner party guests as a perfectly executed à la minute pasta dish.As a Roman-born foodie, I would argue that cacio e pepe, a Roman pasta recipe that is as delicious and simple as it is finicky, is a bold menu choice for the novice cook.The name says it all: pasta, cacio (cheese) and pepe (pepper). That’s it. That’s the recipe.“There is no margin for error with just pasta, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper,” Michele Casadei Massari, CEO and executive chef of Lucciola Italian Restaurant in Manhattan, told CNN via email.“The main challenge lies in achieving a stable emulsion: If the cheese is overheated or the starch-water balance is wrong, the sauce will separate,” Massari said.When that happens, the pecorino forms a gloopy cheesy mess, sticking to everything but the noodles — sad and naked.So, how can one reliably avoid unpleasant dinnertime disasters? Either by practicing a lot — and inevitably making mistakes in the process, as I have — or by using science to guide the way.Eight Italian physicists collaborated to crack the code of a foolproof cacio e pepe recipe, studying the properties of cheese, starch and water at different temperatures to learn how to replicate a flawless dish every time.Experts have pointers for determining whether your olive oil carries the health benefits you’re looking for.Angel Garcia/Bloomberg Creative/Getty ImagesRelated articleHow to know if the olive oil you’re buying is actually good for youThe study was published April 29 in the journalPhysics of Fluids.The magic trick? Adding a precise amount of cornstarch relative to the overall quantity of cheese used, to keep the dreaded clumps at bay.When I first heard about the method, the Roman cuisine purist in me was skeptical.Too many times, I’ve read cheat sheets for the perfect carbonara dish in which the solution to perfect, non-scrambled-egg sauce is to add cream (please, do not do this). In the interest of objectivity, I had to test the recipe myself and talk to these fellow Italians behind the research.Making big batches of cacio e pepeStudy coauthor Daniel Maria Busiello of the University of Padova adds the pecorino cream to the pasta. The secret to the cream's smooth consistency? The unconventional addition of cornstarch.University of PaduaIn a conversation in Italian, three of the study authors shared that the research came from their frustration for one too many cacio e pepe dishes gone wrong. Thanks to the group’s familiarity with the concept of “liquid-liquid phase separation,” they knew how to investigate the problem scientifically.“At some point, the eight of us were all at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden (Germany), some as PhD students, some as postdocs,” said study coauthor Daniel Maria Busiello, a statistical physicist at Italy’s University of Padova. At that time, “something we’d often do was cooking Italian recipes, not just for Italians, but for others as well.”Making big batches of cacio e pepe to feed other hungry scientists turned out to be a near-impossible feat. “There were problems with controlling the temperature of the sauce and of the noodles, causing these clumps,” Busiello said.“I remember a time the dish came out inedible. Something clicked then,” said study coauthor Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the group’s top cooks, and a statistical physicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden.The physics of a pasta problemDi Terlizzi approached fellow researcher Giacomo Bartolucci, now a biophysicist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, with a working theory about possible commonalities between the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce and that of aqueous solutions of proteins inside cells. Bartolucci had focused on phase separation and the aggregation of proteins for his doctoral research.The scientists set out to understand whether the cheese and water in this recipe could be scientifically described as “a system that undergoes phase separation at high temperatures,” in Busiello’s words.“We had a theoretical framework and a practical problem,” Busiello added.Study coauthors (from left) Davide Revignas, Vincenzo Schimmenti and Matteo Ciarchi of the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems were part of the scientific team.Martina GaibaInnovating on traditional Italian recipes, even on solid scientific grounds, is a high-risk endeavor. Given the touchy subject, the study authors are of course all Italians, by design.“If we have to piss off a bunch of people, at least let it be eight Italians who did it,” Di Terlizzi said.To investigate the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce under heat, the researchers conducted experiments recreating the cooking process in a controlled setup.“We prepared small batches of sauce using precise amounts of cheese, starch, and water, and gradually heated them using a sous vide device to carefully control the temperature,” Di Terlizzi explained.“At each stage, we took a small sample of the sauce, placed it in a petri dish and photographed it from above to observe how clumps formed. This allowed us to track how changes in temperature and ingredients affected the smoothness of the sauce.”Avoiding the ‘Mozzarella phase’The researchers found that the concentration of starch in the sauce is the key factor influencing its stability. If the proportion of starch falls below 1% of the total cheese weight, the cheese will enter what the authors call the “Mozzarella phase” — in which clumps are inescapable and the dish is ruined — at lower temperatures. A 2% to 3% starch-to-cheese ratio yields the best results.In the recipe for two published in the study, the researchers used 5 grams (0.18 ounce) of cornstarch or potato starch dissolved in water, heated up gently to form a gel, then cooled down with more water before being blended with 200 grams (7 ounces) of pecorino cheese.Sodium citrate, a common additive used to make smooth mac and cheese, also worked well in their recipe, although according to Di Terlizzi it lent the dish a slightly “cheese single” aftertaste.The scientifically engineered pecorino cream can withstand temperature changes better than the classic cheese-starchy water mixture made with pasta cooking water and can even be reheated.Temperature is in fact another key factor that can make or break the sauce, which has to do with how the proteins in the cheese behave when heated.Writer Francesca Giuliani Hoffman said the more stable, smooth sauce in the scientifically optimized recipe she prepared at home meant the final mixing of the ingredients was less time-sensitive.Francesca Hoffman/CNN“The sauce is stable if created at low temperatures and the starch bonded with the proteins. If, after that happens, you expose the sauce to high temperatures, proteins can no longer interact,” Di Terlizzi said.If the emulsion of cheese and starch happens at high temperatures though, “there’s no guarantee that proteins will bond with other proteins, which causes the aggregation, before they bond with the starch.”The scientifically optimized recipe will yield solid results for large batches of pasta, as the stable sauce will give you more flexibility dealing with a large volume of piping hot noodles, cooling down more slowly than a smaller batch of pasta would.When trying the scientifically optimized recipe, don’t throw away all the pasta cooking water! You’ll still need some of it in the final mixing of all ingredients (the “mantecatura” in Italian). Just be careful to let it cool down slightly.Testing the physicists’ recipeWhen I tested the recipe, the instructions felt straightforward, and the process was quick, though it required a few more steps than what I’m used to (such as forming the starch gel on the stove).It was frankly odd to work with a pecorino cream that felt so smooth — it almost reminded me of a jarred sauce. Nothing changes as far as the pepper goes. Just crack as much of it as you’d like and toast it in a pan to release its aroma.My husband and I enjoyed the dish. It tasted great, and dealing with a pecorino cream that needs much less babying at the stove and allows for a much less time-sensitive mantecatura is a definite plus. Also, who doesn’t love the idea of a cacio e pepe party for a crowd?Middle Eastern cuisine: freshly made hummous, a spread made from chickpeas and seasoned with sumac and oil. Served with flat bread.Ionut Groza/500px/Getty ImagesRelated articleHow to spice up your pantry the Mediterranean wayMy only qualm is that knowing there was starch added in the sauce, my perception of the dish’s mouthfeel was definitely skewed, but that wasn’t the case for my husband.As a proud Roman home cook, my pursuit of a perfect classic cacio e pepe will be a life-long experiment, but the scientifically optimized recipe exceeded my expectations and would be a good initiation for home cooks who have been put off by the dish’s treachery thus far.A chef’s advice for the traditional dishBut what exactly makes the traditional way of making this dish, by emulsifying the cheese with pasta cooking water, so challenging?It’s practically impossible to know just how much starch is naturally present in the pasta cooking water, so the success of the crucial emulsion is more of a gamble, but there are tricks to mitigate catastrophe.One, coming from Massari, is to use less water to boil the pasta.“For cacio e pepe, I recommend using about 6 to 8 cups of water for 7 ounces of pasta, which translates to a ratio closer to 1 part pasta to 6–7 parts water by weight — significantly less than in traditional pasta cooking,” the chef said.A classic rule of thumb for cooking pasta, according to Massari, is to use about 1 quart of water for every 3½ ounces of pasta, and 2 teaspoons of salt.The researchers, who used an arbitrary 10-to-1 ratio of water to pasta in their experiments, also said that reducing that volume of water by two-thirds generally concentrated the natural pasta starch to a safe degree.grilled gyro bashCaitlin BenselRelated article7 simple secrets to eating the Mediterranean wayMassari also recommends emulsifying the cheese and pasta water below 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit), which is in line with the new study’s findings on temperature.“I first create a cold cheese cream, using finely grated Pecorino and a small amount of the pasta’s starchy cooking water, blending until smooth. Then, I toss the pasta off the heat with the cream and freshly cracked black pepper, adding extra water to adjust the texture,” Massari said. “The result should be a silky, cohesive sauce that clings beautifully to every strand of pasta, not a broken or heavy coating.”“The natural starch from properly handled pasta is more than sufficient to achieve a creamy, stable, and authentic sauce without compromising the nutritional integrity of the dish,” Massari added.Another chef’s trick to buy you some time while attempting the recipe the traditional way is “pasta regeneration” — which involves partially cooking the pasta for about 70% of its time, immediately shocking it in ice water to stop gelatinization and finishing it later before serving.“This method preserves al dente texture while enhancing the final release of surface starch, which is crucial for stabilizing delicate emulsions,” Massari explained.Celebrating with their tested recipeThe researchers said their scientifically optimized recipe has surged to meme status, online and offline.“Some social media users were hypercritical about the recipe we proposed, despite it being used before in prestigious restaurants,” Di Terlizzi told CNN. “Overall, I can say that excitement prevailed, especially in the scientific community,” he added.“We won’t say we invented the definitive method,” Di Terlizzi said, but this method will save you from ruining good, expensive and hard-to-source pecorino cheese.Heather Fulbright/CNNRelated articleZa’atar and Rosemary Spiced Roasted AlmondsFor the researchers, that’s personal: “We’re in Germany. We have that shipped to us all the way from Italy. We can’t just buy it at the store every day,” Di Terlizzi said. “So, when the dish turns out badly, that bothers us.”A big pasta dinner celebrated the publication of the paper, with the researchers preparing at least 4 pounds of pasta for a crowd.“We were on pins and needles because our diners all knew about the experiment — but it worked perfectly,” Busiello said.Bartolucci added, “That was our trial by fire.”The scientifically optimized cacio e pepe recipe we testedThis is CNN’s summary of the recipe presented in the study. You can find Pecorino Romano DOP — which stands for Protected Designation of Origin, a certification of a product’s origin and quality assigned by the Italian government and the European Union — and tonnarelli pasta at Italian grocers and online specialty stores.Serves 2Ingredients• Salt• 5 grams (2 teaspoons)cracked black peppercorns, plus more forserving• 5 grams (2 teaspoons) cornstarch or potato starch• 200 grams (1 ½ cups, firmly packed) pregrated Pecorino Romano DOP (such as Fulvi, Locatelli or Cello), plus more for serving• 300 grams (10.6 ounces) pasta, preferably tonnarelli (spaghetti or rigatoni also work well)Instructions1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.2. While the water comes to a boil, add peppercorns in a single layer to a dry pan over medium-low heat. Toast until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pepper from heat immediately.3. Make the starch gel. In a small saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch by whisking it into 50 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold water. Heat the mixture gently over low heat until it thickens and turns nearly clear. Remove the starch gel from heat and whisk in 100 grams (6 ¾ tablespoons) water to cool. The mixture will return to a liquid state.4. Make the pecorino cream. Add the starchy water, grated cheese and peppercornsto the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine until a smooth cream forms.5. Cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente, reserving 237 milliliters (1 cup) of pasta water before draining. Drain the pasta and let cool for up to 1 minute.6. Mix the pasta with the sauce, ensuring even coating, and adjust the consistency by gradually adding pasta water as needed. Keep the sauce slightly runny as it tends to thicken as it cools. If needed, the dish can withstand gentle reheating (up to 80 or 90 C, 176 to 194 F) to reach serving temperature.7. Sprinkle with additional grated cheese and pepper and serve immediately.Chef Michele Casadei Massari’s Cacio e Pepe“I recommend using high-quality spaghettoni pasta made from durum wheat semolina, bronze-extruded and slow-dried at low temperatures,” Massari told CNN. “I prefer using Matt, a heritage durum wheat cultivated mainly in Puglia and Sicily.”You can find matt spaghettoni, Sarawak black peppercorns and Pecorino Romano DOP at online specialty stores.Serves 2Ingredients• Sea salt, preferably coarse Sicilian sea salt• 5 grams (1 teaspoon) freshly cracked Sarawak black peppercorns, plus more for serving• 100 grams (1 cup, firmly packed) pregrated Pecorino Romano DOP (such as Fulvi, Locatelli or Cello), plus more for serving• 200 grams (7 ounces) spaghettoni, preferably matt durum wheat spaghettoniDirections1. Bring 6 to 8 cups of lightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Toast the black pepper in a dry pan over medium-low heat until fragrant. Remove pepper from heat immediately.2. Cook the spaghettoni according to the package directions until slightly al dente, reserving 237 grams (1 cup) of cooking liquid while it’s cooking.3. While the pasta is cooking, prepare a cold emulsion by mixing grated Pecorino Romano with a small ladle of warm pasta water (ideally under 60 C, or 140 F) in a medium bowl until it forms a creamy base.4. Drain the pasta slightly al dente, then transfer it to the pan with the pepper.5. Toss the pasta with the Pecorino cream, gradually adjusting with more pasta water to create a glossy, smooth sauce that perfectly coats the noodles. Add more black pepper and cheese before serving. Serve immediately.Francesca Giuliani Hoffmanis an editorial producer for CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”",

      "content": "New YorkCNN—Even as President Donald Trump pushes a message of self-sacrifice when it comes tohow many dollsAmerican children should own, his administration’s first trade “deal” includes a carveout for cars – luxury ones.Trump on Thursday hailed the fact that theUS-UK framework for trade talkscalls for lowering tariffs on UK cars, saying it wasn’t his intention to persuade “super-luxury” brands including Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar to build cars in the United States.According to afact sheetshared by the White House, the Trump administration has alreadyagreed to lower tariffs on the first 100,000 UK vehicles imported into the United States each year to 10%. Additional vehicles face a 25% tariff.“We took it from 25 to 10 on Rolls-Royce because Rolls-Royce is not gonna be built here. I wouldn’t even ask them to do that. You know, it’s a very special car and it’s a very limited number too,” Trump said, announcing the agreement with Britain in the Oval Office.During the same event, Trump floated slapping a 100% tariff on toys made by Mattel and attacked the company’s CEO after theBarbie and Hot Wheels maker saidits toys couldn’t be manufactured in America and still besold at affordable prices.The United Kingdom exported only about 90,000 cars to the United States last year, according to S&P Global Mobility, making it the sixth-largest source of imported vehicles, responsible for only 1% of imported cars.US Commerce Department data showed that the value of cars imported from the UK came to $12.3 billion, meaning that the average price of a British import was more than $135,000.“It’s not… one of the monster car companies that makes millions of cars. They make a very small number of cars that are super-luxury and that includes Bentley and Jaguar… some very special cars,” Trump said. “That’s really… handmade stuff and they’ve been doing it for a long time in the same location,” he added, noting that he wanted to help the makers of such cars.Other luxury British car brands that could benefit from the lowered tariffs include Land Rover, Aston Martin and Mini.That means Trump has made it cheaper to import cars that relatively few Americans buy – or, for that matter, can afford – while keeping tariffs for now onmore popular and affordable brands, mostly imported from countries other than the UK.“Laser focused on reducing prices for everyday Americans from Day One,” University of Michigan economist Justin Wolferspostedon X, “the President has struck a deal that will lower the price of Rolls Royces, Bentleys, Jaguars, Aston Martin’s, Range Rovers and Minis.”Wolfersnoted that “no other consumer good received carveouts” from the US-UK trade framework.Meanwhile, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz saidit’s unlikely Trump’s tariffs will cause toy manufacturing to come to America.“We don’t see that happening,” the Mattel CEO told CNBC after the company warned that tariffs willincrease toy pricesfor American consumers.﻿Trump fired back, saying: “We’ll put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won’t sell one toy in the United States, and that’s their biggest market.” Trump added: “I wouldn’t wanna have him as an executive too long.”Of course, a 100% tariff on America’s leading toy company would likely cause an even bigger jump in toy prices charged to US consumers. It could also make it very difficult or virtually impossible for parents to buy new Barbies and other toys. Retailers typically start stocking up over the summer for the holiday shopping season.Ken Griffin, the hedge fund billionaire who backed Trump in the 2024 election,told CNBCthis week that tariffs are a “painfully regressive tax” that will “hit the pocketbook of hardworking Americans the hardest.”In an interview withPolitico, Griffin added that “tariffs open the door to crony capitalism,” with the government picking winners and losers. “I thought this would play out over the course of years. It’s terrifying to watch this play out over the course of weeks,” he said.CNN’s Maria Sole Campinoti contributed to this report.",

      "content": "CNN—US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee outlinedan American-Israeli planto funnel humanitarian aid into parts of Gaza that he acknowledged will initially feed only about 60% of the population.Huckabee said the aid mechanism, which will be administered by a newly formed private foundation stood up by the US, will aim to distribute food in a way that “Hamas is not able to get their hands on it.”Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of stealing and profiting off aid shipments to Gaza, but humanitarian aid organizations say the overwhelming majority of food aid reaches civilians in need.Under the US-Israeli plan, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, as it’s called, would set up distribution sites that would be secured by private US military contractors and manned by aid workers. The Israeli military would “be involved in providing necessary military security” outside the immediate area of the distribution sites, Huckabee said, speaking at the US embassy in Jerusalem.An Israeli army tank maneuvers in the Gaza Strip is seen from southern Israel on May 4.Ariel Schalit/APRelated articleIsrael vows to escalate war with new plan to ‘conquer’ GazaThe foundation will initially establish four distribution sites which will aim to provide “pre-packaged rations, hygiene kits, and medical supplies” to a total of 1.2 million Palestinians, or about 60% of Gaza’s population, according to a foundation document obtained by CNN.Pressed by CNN what the remaining 40% of Gaza’s population is expected to do, Huckabee said the mechanism will be “scaled up” over time.“You have to start somewhere and the somewhere feeds an enormous level of the people of Gaza,” Huckabee said, before repeatedly blaming Hamas for rising hunger in Gaza. Aid groups have repeatedly attributed hunger in Gaza to Israel’s total blockade of humanitarian relief.The planning has been going on for months but kicked into high gear in the last few weeks, said a source familiar with the matter, cautioning that there is still “a significant amount of planning and resourcing to be done.”“The genuine intention is to develop a secure way to deliver aid that does not enable Hamas or (Palestinian Islamic Jihad) to get their hands on the aid before it reaches the point of need. In the hands of individual Palestinian families in Gaza,” the source added, saying both the US and Israel have no confidence in the United Nations-based system that has been used in the past.There appear to have been some attempts to sway parties reluctant to join the mechanism. US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff held an “informal briefing” with UN Security Council members on Wednesday, where Gaza was discussed, according to a source familiar with the matter.Hamas said the new proposal was part of “Israeli plans for displacement and subjugation through a policy of starvation.”In a statement released Friday afternoon, Hamas called on the international community “to take urgent action to prevent the militarization of aid and its transformation into a tool for managing starvation and a blatant violation of humanitarian standards.”UN rejects planThe United Nations and other primary aid groups in Gaza have rejected the US-Israeli plan, which they say would facilitate the forced displacement of Palestinians and fail to meet the needs of the population.“This mechanism appears practically unfeasible, incompatible with humanitarian principles and will create serious insecurity risks, all while failing to meet Israel’s obligations under international law,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs wrote this week in a document obtained by CNN.The UN also criticized the plan for a critically low number of distribution sites instead of the roughly 400 that operated in Gaza before Israel’s total blockade. With only a handful of sites under the plan the Trump administration is pushing, displaced Palestinians could be forced to walk long distances carrying heavy packages of rations for large families.People queue with pots to receive charity meals from a kitchen in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip on April 24.Bashar Taleb/AFP via Getty ImagesUN agencies have instead called on Israel to lift its nearly 10-week siege on Gaza and allow aid to flow in freely, which Israel has rejected.The main UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said Friday that “basic humanitarian supplies, including food, fuel, medical aid and vaccines for children, are rapidly running out; UNRWA flour and food parcels have run out and over one third of essential medical supplies are already out of stock.”“This is having a devastating impact on the population, particularly on vulnerable groups including children, women and the elderly,” UNRWA said.Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the organization representing Palestinian aid groups working in Gaza, told CNN it had received no information about the proposal and said the organizations involved in the US plan would “not consider the basic humanitarian principle of our people.”Starvation is ‘the greatest danger’Huckabee acknowledged the deteriorating situation in Gaza, saying: “The greatest danger, the most important danger, people starving to death.”“If there wasn’t a humanitarian crisis, there wouldn’t be an effort to try to deal with it. So the answer is, obviously yes, there is a humanitarian crisis,” Huckabee told CNN.Huckabee said “several partners” have agreed to participate in the new mechanism, but he declined to name them “because some of the details of their participation are being worked out.” He repeatedly said the plan is not yet finalized and said the initial implementation “will not be perfect, especially in the early days.”Israeli officials continue to deny the extent of the crisis created by the military’s blockade that began on March 2.On Wednesday, Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Heskel told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that “the situation in Gaza is very far from what the reports are actually saying” and called reports of starvation “complete lies.”KHAN YUNIS, GAZA - APRIL 29: Displaced Palestinians receive hot meals distributed by aid organizations in al-Mawasi area of Khan Yunis, Gaza on April 29, 2025.

And it will take several more weeks before the program can be scaled up to serve a larger share of Gaza’s population.But the very launch of the mechanism is still in question amid opposition from the major humanitarian aid players.“Everyone who’s been saying there’s a crisis, I expect them to step up and to now join the effort to resolve it,” Huckabee said.Some humanitarian aid players have signed up, according to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation document obtained by CNN. The former CEO of disaster response organization Team Rubicon is expected to serve as executive director; and the former chief executive of World Central Kitchen Nate Mook is expected to serve on the board of directors.But in a sign of how many aspects of the plan are still being finalized, the former executive director of the UN’s World Food Programme, David Beasely is only one tentatively listed as joining the foundation’s advisory board, with “to be finalized” appended to his name.CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.",

Our scopes just went black again,” an air traffic controller directed a flight that had just taken off, in audio recorded by the website LiveATC.net. “If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure for them to fix this stuff.”The FedEx plane, bound for Boston, was then directed to contact controllers at a different frequency.“Sorry to hear about that, FedEx 1989,” the pilot said. “I’m switching, good luck guys.”Related articleNEWARK, NEW JERSEY - MAY 6:  Planes are parked at Terminal C in Newark Liberty International Airport, on May 6, 2025 in Newark, New Jersey. Passengers traveling to, from, or through Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) have experienced several days of delays and cancellations caused by air traffic control staffing shortages and equipment malfunctions.(Photo by Andres Kudacki/Getty Images)Andres Kudacki/Getty ImagesInternal FAA report downplayed risks of data outage affecting Newark air traffic controllersThe outage is thelatest in a seriesof troubling technical problems that have impacted the air traffic control system in the United States.In the afternoon of April 28, an outage of radar and communications at the same facility left controllers unable to talk to planes or see where they were located. As CNN previously reported, at least five controllers took 45 days of trauma leave after that incident, leading to a staffing shortage that canceled and delayed more than a thousand flights.No controllers took leave after the Friday morning outage.The two incidents are distinctly different in the timing and number of planes impacted.The Friday morning outage happened when few planes were arriving or departing, while the April 28 incident took place during a busy afternoon with about 16 aircraft being controlled at the time. About half of those flights ended up being diverted to other nearby airports.As of Friday evening there were 479 delays and 142 cancellations reported at Newark, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.Staffing issues for Newark Terminal Radar Approach Control are noted in the publicly available FAA operations plan for nearly the entire day, and the flow of aircraft is being managed due to “staffing constraints.”Bad weather, including low clouds, and runway construction are also delaying Newark flights today.Thursday the Department of Transportationannouncedan overhaul of the nation’s air traffic control system.“What we’re seeing through the system is, you know, hundreds of times a week, blips in connectivity, which is a sign that you’re seeing issues with your telecom,” Secretary Sean Duffy told CNN after the announcement.",
